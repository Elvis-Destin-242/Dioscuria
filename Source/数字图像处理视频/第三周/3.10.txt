Exploiting MATLAB once again, we're going 
to illustrate an example of median filter. 
So we're creating three images now. Image I is the original image, 
we're going to see it in a second. Image J is this image, but we have added 
salt and pepper noise. That's basically strong noise as we're 
going to observe soon, that is dark and white pixels. 
And image K is going to be the median filter operation on the noisy image. 
And I'm going to show you I, J, and K. So let's see that. 
We have three images. This figure is the original image, 
this is the one with salt and pepper noise. 
We see these black pixels, so basic pixels were completely changed their 
pixel value to, from white to black. And here, we see the result of median 
filtering, which is I think very impressive for such 
a simple filter. It got completely rid of all the noise 
that we had. It does blur a bit the image as we know 
the actual data, as we know from when we learned the operation of the median 
filter. But it did manage to get rid of the noise 
and provide us a much more pleasant image. 
So, this is an example of median filtering operating inside MATLAB and 
with some of the images that come with the MATLAB package. 
Thank you, and see you in the next video.
