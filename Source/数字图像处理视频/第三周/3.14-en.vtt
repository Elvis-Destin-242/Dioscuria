00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.467
. 
Thank you very much for spending this 

2
00:00:03.467 --> 00:00:07.017
week with me. 
I think we have learned a lot, we learned 

3
00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:10.960
a lot of very important basic concepts on 
image enhancement. 

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.350
And next week we are going to learn even 
more and we are getting close to the end 

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.958
of the first half of this class which is 
basically the basic fundamental the 

6
00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.812
mentioned concepts. 
And as we talk earlier, the second half 

7
00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:28.467
will be about more advanced topics in 
image processing. 

8
00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:33.451
For those that are interested, we are 
going to conclude this week with some 

9
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:38.942
hints in my board that I left you to 
prove what we saw in the previous video 

10
00:00:38.942 --> 00:00:44.778
about gradients, and what's a gradient? 
What that it means to go in a gradient. 

11
00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:50.539
What is the direction of maximal change? 
So if you can sneak in the back, and 

12
00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.791
actually have half of the proof there. 
That's unnecessary for you to keep 

13
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:59.586
understanding what's going to happen in 
the next six weeks. 

14
00:00:59.586 --> 00:01:03.381
This is only if you're super curious 
about that concept. 

15
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:06.092
Thank you very much. 
It's very dark here. 

16
00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:10.700
It's night at Duke University and I'm 
going to see you again next week. 

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.920
Thank you. 
Bye-bye.
