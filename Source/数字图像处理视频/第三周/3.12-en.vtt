00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
Hello and welcome back. 
We are going to be using once again, 

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.731
MATLAB to illustrate what we just learned 
about answer masking, and a few 

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:11.710
additional operations. 
So, let's go into that. 

4
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.446
First we're going to read an image, one 
of the images that come with the matter 

5
00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:20.633
package. 
Then we're going to add, salt and pepper 

6
00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:23.042
noise. 
We see here point zero nine meaning, that 

7
00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:28.566
about 9% of the pixels in the image, are 
going to be contaminated by salt, white, 

8
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:33.453
or pepper, meaning black noise. 
After that, we're going to apply to the 

9
00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:37.702
noisy image, medium filtering, and we see 
that operation here. 

10
00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:40.890
And then we're going to load, the 
original image. 

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.718
The noisy image, the medium filter 
result, meaning the denoised image. The 

12
00:00:45.718 --> 00:00:50.748
difference between these two as one 
possibility of [INAUDIBLE] masking and 

13
00:00:50.748 --> 00:00:54.907
also a stretch histogram. 
And we're going to see and discuss each 

14
00:00:54.907 --> 00:00:58.662
one of these more. 
So let's just first load all the five 

15
00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:03.022
images and see what happens. 
I'm going to move them around so we can 

16
00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:06.470
look at all of them at once. 
So, 

17
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.630
this is once again, we see here first the 
original image. 

18
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.941
Then we see the salt and pepper noise. 
When the background is white, we can see 

19
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:21.912
the black dots, basically the pepper. 
When the background is dark, when the 

20
00:01:21.912 --> 00:01:25.590
background is dark, we can see the white 
dots, the salt. 

21
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.175
Here we see the result of applying a 
three by three medium filter to this 

22
00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:33.088
image. 
And we see that we managed to clean the 

23
00:01:33.088 --> 00:01:35.939
noise. 
And we managed to clean pretty much the 

24
00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.037
whole image. 
Of course, we have some blurring not a 

25
00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:42.260
lot, but some blurring produced by the 
medium filter. 

26
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.970
So it's not exactly the original image. 
It's kind of a blurred version of it. 

27
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.355
Which means that if we take now the 
difference between these two images, 

28
00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:58.190
we're going to get this, which is mostly 
the edges the basically sharp boundaries 

29
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.279
in this image. 
This image is a bit too dark and 

30
00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:06.538
therefore what we do as we know we can 
stretch the histogram and in this case we 

31
00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:11.994
just square the pixel values and by that 
we are stretching the histogram and we 

32
00:02:11.994 --> 00:02:15.740
see here the results. 
So here is basically, the difference 

33
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.868
between the original, the medium filter 
of the noise filter, that's that and we 

34
00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:23.010
have stretching. 
Now, 

35
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.624
observe that we don't see edges, because 
of the noise. 

36
00:02:26.624 --> 00:02:31.739
Those would be superios edges, won't be 
real edges in the original image. 

37
00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.786
And that basically happens because we 
have applied a medium filter before 

38
00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:41.219
producing these difference. 
And that's actually great, because the 

39
00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.356
medium filter manages to get rid of the 
noise. 

40
00:02:44.356 --> 00:02:49.812
And therefore managed to get rid of the 
possibility of having superious edges. 

41
00:02:49.812 --> 00:02:54.382
So in this example, we see a lot of the 
things that we have learned. 

42
00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:58.040
We see salt and pepper noise, 
result of medium filter. 

43
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.803
The difference producing the most 
important edges and an histogram 

44
00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:07.426
stretching to be able to observe those 
edges in a much nicer way. 

45
00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:10.928
Thank you very much, and see you in the 
next video.
