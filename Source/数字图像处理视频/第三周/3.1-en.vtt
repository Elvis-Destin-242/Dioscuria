00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.726
Hello, and welcome to week three of our 
class on image and video processing. 

2
00:00:04.726 --> 00:00:08.570
What you're seeing right now is me in a 
relatively dark room. 

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.737
You can probably see the Duke Chapel 
behind me but you can't see details, for 

4
00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:16.447
example, the color of the shirt I'm 
wearing. 

5
00:00:16.447 --> 00:00:21.299
Or, if you were to look at my desk, it's 
basically very dark, and you can't see 

6
00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:24.072
much. 
What happen when we take an image like 

7
00:00:24.072 --> 00:00:26.970
this? 
What happen when we have a video that is 

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.058
very dark? 
That happens us all the time, we take a 

9
00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:33.678
picture at night. 
Doesn't have the lighting that we want. 

10
00:00:33.678 --> 00:00:36.815
It's too dark or too bright, 
sometimes too noisy. 

11
00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:42.108
What we are going to do during this week 
is to learn how to improve those images. 

12
00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:46.225
How to enhance those images. 
We're going to start with very simple 

13
00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:49.716
manipulations. 
That will basically help us to improve 

14
00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:54.208
the contrast, remove the noise. 
And we're going to go towards the end of 

15
00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:59.295
the week to more advanced techniques. 
Which are basically leading to state of 

16
00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:03.193
the art approaches today. 
And we're going to come back to some 

17
00:01:03.193 --> 00:01:08.016
these towards the end of the class to 
basically week seven, week eight, to 

18
00:01:08.016 --> 00:01:11.650
really, really advance techniques for 
image enhancement. 

19
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.759
During this week and during the following 
weeks we're also going to do online and 

20
00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.682
real time demos so I'm going to basically 
teach you some of the material and then 

21
00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:26.293
we're going to run some different 
software platforms to basically do some 

22
00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:29.974
of these operations. 
Right now on my PC, and you are going to 

23
00:01:29.974 --> 00:01:32.738
see them, in practice, how they are 
working. 

24
00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:37.739
We're also going to introduce some online 
video quizzes so, basically I'm going to 

25
00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:42.805
pause for a second and you're going to be 
able to think about a question that I 

26
00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:46.424
will post to you. 
That won't basically affect your, your 

27
00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:51.754
certificate at the end but it's just to 
have you think for a while before I give 

28
00:01:51.754 --> 00:01:56.953
you the answer to the question, like in 
any regular class that I will basically 

29
00:01:56.953 --> 00:01:59.980
pause to have the students think for a 
minute. 

30
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.860
Before we continue let me turn on the 
lights so I can continue this and write. 

31
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.490
And explain to you the basic principles 
of image enhancement and contrast 

32
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.808
enhancement and image you're now seeing. 
So bear with me for a second. 

33
00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:17.997
I'm going to turn on my lights and we 
will be right back. 

34
00:02:17.997 --> 00:02:21.980
So now I'm turning the lights on. 
So you can see. 

35
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.831
A bit of the details. 
you can't see much in the background 

36
00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:29.820
anymore but you can see what's in the 
room. 

37
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.174
And what I'm going to show you is how we 
turn the lights on, digitally, in the 

38
00:02:35.174 --> 00:02:37.816
computer. 
So you have taken your image. 

39
00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:42.538
You can now go back to SIM. 
I want to turn the lights on with image 

40
00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:47.583
processing and video processing software 
so let's start doing that. 

41
00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:52.930
And we basically are going to start from 
very simple operations, which are 

42
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.545
histogram modifications, or pointwise 
operations. 

43
00:02:56.545 --> 00:03:00.620
So, the basic idea is illustrated in this 
figure. 

44
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.592
Every pixel of the image, 
it's going to change it's own value, 

45
00:03:07.592 --> 00:03:12.020
following certain function. 
So. 

46
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.360
The pixel here will move to a new image 
where basically it changed its value but 

47
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.090
it will change its value only based on 
its own value right now. 

48
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.868
It's not going to be influenced by 
anything that's happening in any other 

49
00:03:26.868 --> 00:03:30.678
part of the image. 
That's the first part of this week three. 

50
00:03:30.678 --> 00:03:36.102
We're going to see later how we basically 
influence the pixel value by other things 

51
00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:40.686
that are happening in the image. 
But to start, very simple, what's called 

52
00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:44.690
point-wise operations. 
There's a certain pixel value in, in the 

53
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.402
input, a certain pixel value in the 
output. 

54
00:03:47.402 --> 00:03:50.759
Similarly here. 
For example, what's happening here is 

55
00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:57.060
that everybody up to pixel value K. 
Becomes zero, everybody above K becomes 

56
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.665
one or the maximum value. 
In the image. 

57
00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:04.414
So this is basically a thresh holding 
operation. 

58
00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:10.507
So, what we need to specify, is it one 
dimensional function, that translates the 

59
00:04:10.507 --> 00:04:15.003
input to the output. 
And, let's just see, a few examples of 

60
00:04:15.003 --> 00:04:18.720
that. 
So here we see a few illustrations of 

61
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.653
this. 
Several of these operations, inverse log. 

62
00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:29.295
Of course lets start from the identity. 
The input is identical to the output. 

63
00:04:29.295 --> 00:04:35.500
So basically this is the identity. 
If we basically mark the output as S. 

64
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.070
An entity is S = R. 
The output is identical to the input. 

65
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.450
We have done nothing to the image. 
We also have a log operation. 

66
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:56.376
For example the output is some constant 
times the log of the input, and we 

67
00:04:56.376 --> 00:05:03.378
normally are going to add let's say 1. 
Because if the input is 0, we cannot take 

68
00:05:03.378 --> 00:05:06.367
the logarithmic of zero. 
So we do we this. 

69
00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:11.399
So that's an hour operation. 
Whatever is the grade value of the input 

70
00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:16.138
we transform it to the output. 
There is also the inverse, which is 

71
00:05:16.138 --> 00:05:19.711
written here. 
And I want to, I want for you to think 

72
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:25.617
for a second, what will be basically the 
function that will represent the inverse. 

73
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:30.880
Considering that our image goes from 0 to 
L. 

74
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.501
So the minimal value is 0, the maximum 
value is L. 

75
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:40.600
While would be the function, basically I 
want to write S. 

76
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.187
As a function of r. 
Why would be that function that will 

77
00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:49.170
basically do the negation of the image. 
The maximal value of the input will 

78
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.292
become zero. 
And the minimal value of the input 

79
00:05:52.292 --> 00:05:57.607
meaning zero would become L. 
So let's just think for a second and it's 

80
00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:01.128
a very simple exercise just to illustrate 
how simple. 

81
00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:06.244
And as we are going to see in a second, 
how powerful at the same time, these type 

82
00:06:06.244 --> 00:06:12.249
of operations are. 
So, we know that, basically, I ask you 

83
00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:16.223
how to, basically, construct this 
function? 

84
00:06:16.223 --> 00:06:23.900
And it's very simple. 
We want the output to be the inverse. 

85
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.295
of the input, so S equal L, the maximum 
value minus R. 

86
00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:34.691
So when R is L, S becomes zero because 
its L minus L. 

87
00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:41.332
When R is zero, then basically S become 
L, which is the maximum. 

88
00:06:41.332 --> 00:06:47.977
So, a very, very simple operation that 
just involves our great values. 

89
00:06:47.977 --> 00:06:53.455
And note, that all what occur in all of 
these operations, is the actual great 

90
00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:56.844
value. 
I'm not asking where's the pixel located 

91
00:06:56.844 --> 00:07:00.592
in the image? 
I'm just asking what's the pixel value? 

92
00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:07.540
What's the great value of that image? 
So, here is one example of this. 

93
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:14.176
Basically this function that we just 
wrote S equal L minus R is basically 

94
00:07:14.176 --> 00:07:20.812
taking every pixel and doing the 
inversion so it's the negative image and 

95
00:07:20.812 --> 00:07:27.000
some of the things that we see is that is 
basically easier for us to. 

96
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.010
See just visually some of the things in 
the negative image than it is. 

97
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.782
In that original image. 
And why is this? 

98
00:07:35.782 --> 00:07:40.973
Remember early on we talk about the 
properties of the visual system that 

99
00:07:40.973 --> 00:07:44.741
there are certain contrast that we 
understand better. 

100
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:49.150
That we perceive better at different 
levels of the background. 

101
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:54.622
And we saw that there are some contrasts 
that are perceived better when we are in 

102
00:07:54.622 --> 00:07:58.493
the dark regions. 
Some contrasts are perceived differently 

103
00:07:58.493 --> 00:08:03.298
when we are in the light regions. 
So, this inversion, basically, might help 

104
00:08:03.298 --> 00:08:08.170
us to perceive things that are difficult 
to notice in the original image. 

105
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:13.186
Very simple illustration. 
One other important thing of these type 

106
00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:18.281
of operations is, I can go back. 
So, if I start from here, I have not 

107
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:23.220
destroyed the information. 
I can simply go back and reverse this 

108
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.778
operation, that's not always possible as 
we're going to see later this week. 

109
00:08:28.778 --> 00:08:33.160
But, for this particular operation that 
is doable. 

110
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:40.029
Another extremely important operation is 
basically an exponential function, and 

111
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:46.378
I'm going to write it here S, the output 
is going to be a constant, the input, to 

112
00:08:46.378 --> 00:08:52.813
some exponent, gamma, and the basic idea 
here is that depending on, gamma in 

113
00:08:52.813 --> 00:08:59.596
particular we get different functions, 
that transforms the input, to the output, 

114
00:08:59.596 --> 00:09:03.683
and this is very often called gamma 
correction. 

115
00:09:03.683 --> 00:09:09.604
And this actually is very popular. 
In monitors, because of some properties 

116
00:09:09.604 --> 00:09:15.533
of the monitor, if you don't do a gamma 
correction to your image, your image is 

117
00:09:15.533 --> 00:09:18.650
going to look relatively dark. 
So, if this is. 

118
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.941
My image its going to look dark, and it's 
going be hard to perceive exactly the 

119
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:27.156
details. 
And that's because of the properties of 

120
00:09:27.156 --> 00:09:30.773
the monitor. 
So sometimes before you send the image to 

121
00:09:30.773 --> 00:09:35.260
the display to the monitor you do what's 
called a gamma correction. 

122
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.418
So you gamma correct the image, and then 
you basically send it to the display. 

123
00:09:40.418 --> 00:09:45.040
And what's basically the gamma correction 
is doing is inverting this. 

124
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.402
Darkening operation that happens due to 
some properties in the monitor. 

125
00:09:50.402 --> 00:09:53.725
So it's a very useful, very common 
operation. 

126
00:09:53.725 --> 00:09:58.118
Basically shows up. 
In virtually every monitor there is a 

127
00:09:58.118 --> 00:10:02.399
gamma correction before the image is 
basically display. 

128
00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:08.471
But gamma correction or basically this 
exponential function is very useful in 

129
00:10:08.471 --> 00:10:13.608
general to basically kind of stretch if 
you need the pixel values. 

130
00:10:13.608 --> 00:10:18.657
Remember we have instagrams and. 
Which are the distributions of the 

131
00:10:18.657 --> 00:10:21.725
pixels. 
And, for example, if we look at this 

132
00:10:21.725 --> 00:10:27.424
image it looks like most of the pixels 
are concentrated on the bright values. 

133
00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:30.420
So, if we were to draw, and we're going 
to do. 

134
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.567
This. 
This event. 

135
00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:36.946
Very often, basically starting, in the 
next in the next video, but allowed in 

136
00:10:36.946 --> 00:10:40.101
this way. 
So, probably, if we were to plug the 

137
00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:45.623
distribution of the pixel values of this 
image, there would occupy a lot, this 

138
00:10:45.623 --> 00:10:48.564
region. 
Because we look like the image is 

139
00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:52.150
basically too much of the high values, 
very bright. 

140
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:57.815
So, with gamma corrections, we can manage 
to actually stretch this histogram and 

141
00:10:57.815 --> 00:11:03.194
this are just different values, but I 
think the simplest is to just look at 

142
00:11:03.194 --> 00:11:07.911
this one. 
And we see that we have basically a nicer 

143
00:11:07.911 --> 00:11:11.665
image it looks better than this image 
first of all. 

144
00:11:11.665 --> 00:11:17.700
But it also helps us to better understand 
some of the details and I hope that you 

145
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:23.000
can still in your own monitor that it's 
doing its own gamma correction. 

146
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.859
Then you can actually perceive better, 
details here, details here, and in 

147
00:11:27.859 --> 00:11:32.651
different regions in the image. 
And sometimes, it might become too much, 

148
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:35.526
so you might do a different type of 
gamma. 

149
00:11:35.526 --> 00:11:38.880
So you might say oh, this region 
actually, I'm not. 

150
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.114
... 
Perceiving a lot of the details. 

151
00:11:41.114 --> 00:11:45.199
So maybe I should a different value of 
gamma as illustrated here. 

152
00:11:45.199 --> 00:11:48.262
This are researches of different values 
of gamma. 

153
00:11:48.262 --> 00:11:53.433
And you could actually do some of these 
operations not in the whole image but in 

154
00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:57.773
some regions of the image. 
So you can invert only some region of the 

155
00:11:57.773 --> 00:12:00.390
image. 
You can do a gamma correction or an 

156
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.901
exponential function in only some regions 
of the image. 

157
00:12:03.901 --> 00:12:08.050
So you don't have to do them every place. 
You can do them locally. 

158
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.471
So that's. 
A very simple operation, that immediately 

159
00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:15.637
gives us a much nicer perception of the 
image. 

160
00:12:15.637 --> 00:12:19.629
Remember the video, as we started this 
video, was very dark. 

161
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:24.240
That means that the distribution, 
basically peaks of values. 

162
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.786
Were around here. 
If this is the histogram distribution and 

163
00:12:28.786 --> 00:12:34.950
this kind of operation help us to stretch 
to basically use better the resources 

164
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:41.192
that we have in the display to use the 
whole spectrum of values from 0 to 255 

165
00:12:41.192 --> 00:12:47.433
instead of just using the dark part of 
the values or only the bright part of the 

166
00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:50.670
values. 
Again a very, very simple operation. 

167
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:58.222
here there is a lot of art in designing 
of these operations but with experience 

168
00:12:58.222 --> 00:13:03.331
we understand what we need to do. 
Here is yet in our example of the 

169
00:13:03.331 --> 00:13:08.745
stretching of the pixel values. 
So once again this is the input, this is 

170
00:13:08.745 --> 00:13:14.235
R, this is S, this is the output. 
So if your pixel values are between this 

171
00:13:14.235 --> 00:13:17.590
point and this point not a lot is 
happening. 

172
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.339
Okay. 
So this is going to be the original 

173
00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:23.357
image. 
Pixels values that are relatively dark, 

174
00:13:23.357 --> 00:13:28.320
not a lot is going to happen to it, then. 
Pixels that are relatively bright. 

175
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.681
Not a lot is going to happen to them but 
pickus value in between are going to be 

176
00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:41.114
stretch basically I'm going to, this has 
slope much larger than one. 

177
00:13:41.114 --> 00:13:44.976
If the slope was one, nothing will happen 
to them. 

178
00:13:44.976 --> 00:13:49.625
If the slope is less than one, it would 
be basic contracted. 

179
00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:53.880
If the slope is larger than one, it would 
be stretched. 

180
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.505
Okay? 
So if we have slope larger than one, zero 

181
00:13:57.505 --> 00:14:01.445
stays zero. 
But one basically goes up to the slope 

182
00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:05.307
and gets stretched. 
And then we see what happened. 

183
00:14:05.307 --> 00:14:10.901
This is the retaliament because the 
mid-range of the pixel values gets 

184
00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:14.479
stretched. 
All of a sudden, I can see details that I 

185
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:18.838
couldn't see before. 
Look at the points here are extremely 

186
00:14:18.838 --> 00:14:24.994
difficult to notice, but here I can see 
that actually there were spots in this 

187
00:14:24.994 --> 00:14:28.546
image. 
And then if you wish you can threshold 

188
00:14:28.546 --> 00:14:34.701
that image and that's whats happened here 
so we can distinguish the different 

189
00:14:34.701 --> 00:14:38.489
regions. 
But notice the difference of going from 

190
00:14:38.489 --> 00:14:43.231
here to here, very hard to understand. 
What's happening here? 

191
00:14:43.231 --> 00:14:49.605
Much nicer looking image here, not only 
much nicer looking, but I can also see 

192
00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:56.227
the details in the image, and that's very 
important for image analysis, and I can 

193
00:14:56.227 --> 00:15:02.270
do simple things like thresholding. 
So everything that's happened here is 

194
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:07.403
extremely, extremely simple operations. 
By the way, this is this. 

195
00:15:07.403 --> 00:15:10.880
Going from here to here, basically, is 
also. 

196
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.505
A very simple operation. 
We actually saw it before. 

197
00:15:14.505 --> 00:15:17.694
It's an operation of this tie. 
Okay? 

198
00:15:17.694 --> 00:15:23.085
So, this is S, this is R. 
The sum of the pixel values go to zero if 

199
00:15:23.085 --> 00:15:29.222
they are below this particular value. 
And if they are above, they go to the 

200
00:15:29.222 --> 00:15:33.285
maximal value that they can display in 
the image. 

201
00:15:33.285 --> 00:15:39.008
So very simple operation can do drastic 
transformations in the image. 

202
00:15:39.008 --> 00:15:43.360
And very useful transformations in the 
image. 

203
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:50.679
A couple of additional examples, here. 
We have, it's kind of a thresh hold, but 

204
00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:54.964
in the mid range. 
So, basically we say, okay, anybody that 

205
00:15:54.964 --> 00:15:58.471
goes from zero to A, I want it to be very 
low. 

206
00:15:58.471 --> 00:16:04.549
Everybody that is above B, I wand it to 
be very low, and everybody in between, I 

207
00:16:04.549 --> 00:16:08.501
want it to be very high. 
And, this is another example. 

208
00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:12.590
Basically everybody between zero and 
eight, don't touch. 

209
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:17.652
Everybody above B, don't touch. 
Everybody between A and B make it very, 

210
00:16:17.652 --> 00:16:21.688
very bright, or I could say, make it 
very, very dark, okay? 

211
00:16:21.688 --> 00:16:27.704
So let's assume that you have information 
that the pixel values of your region of 

212
00:16:27.704 --> 00:16:33.794
interest are between A and B and you want 
them to be highlighted in the image, then 

213
00:16:33.794 --> 00:16:37.903
you do this type of operation or this 
type of operation. 

214
00:16:37.903 --> 00:16:41.792
Let's just see the effects of that in the 
next slide. 

215
00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:48.089
This is the original image here. 
And this is the first operation, where we 

216
00:16:48.089 --> 00:16:54.228
basically take a wrench of the image, and 
that wrench of the image we'll make very 

217
00:16:54.228 --> 00:16:57.821
brighter. 
Very bright, everything else, we'll make 

218
00:16:57.821 --> 00:17:00.609
very dark. 
And this is another example. 

219
00:17:00.609 --> 00:17:05.199
This is the second example where we take 
a region of the image. 

220
00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:08.405
And we only change that region of the 
image. 

221
00:17:08.405 --> 00:17:13.650
Everything else basically stays the same. 
Of course, you need information. 

222
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.167
What's the region that I care of. 
And that comes, as I say, from 

223
00:17:18.167 --> 00:17:21.664
experience. 
Offer information about the sin that 

224
00:17:21.664 --> 00:17:23.850
you're capturing. 
In this case. 

225
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:29.640
Basically, information about the biology 
and what kind of pixel values. 

226
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.894
This region of the image appears. 
And that's a region that I'm going to 

227
00:17:34.894 --> 00:17:40.296
basically say that I need to make it 
brighter or I to make it darker and 

228
00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:44.218
similarly here. 
The, the goal of this is to illustrate 

229
00:17:44.218 --> 00:17:49.103
how very, very simple operations can get 
us basically what we want. 

230
00:17:49.103 --> 00:17:54.579
Can get us to improve the visual 
appearance of the images, going from very 

231
00:17:54.579 --> 00:18:00.351
dark or very bright to very uniform and 
nice looking images or can help us to 

232
00:18:00.351 --> 00:18:03.618
basically highlight the region of 
interest. 

233
00:18:03.618 --> 00:18:09.240
If you want to do the analysis of this 
region in the image, maybe it's nice to 

234
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:14.502
basically make everything as dark. 
So I can concentrate my attention here. 

235
00:18:14.502 --> 00:18:18.683
But maybe you say, yes. 
But I lost details, because you made 

236
00:18:18.683 --> 00:18:20.845
everything white. 
You say, okay. 

237
00:18:20.845 --> 00:18:24.810
Then let's do something else. 
Let's just take the whole. 

238
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.824
Background, basically, and make it zero. 
But let's not change this range of 

239
00:18:29.824 --> 00:18:32.984
values. 
And this is the type of operation that 

240
00:18:32.984 --> 00:18:36.487
appears here. 
We make everything that we don't like 

241
00:18:36.487 --> 00:18:40.745
just very dark or very bright. 
But everything we care, we leave 

242
00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:43.150
untouched. 
And then we can actually. 

243
00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:48.530
Concentrate our visual observation with 
concentrate only on that region. 

244
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:53.195
So these are very simple operations. 
In the next video we're going to start 

245
00:18:53.195 --> 00:18:58.185
talking about histogram equalization but 
before that, let's just make a short 

246
00:18:58.185 --> 00:19:03.433
video that basically run some of these 
operations in real time so we can see how 

247
00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:08.099
simple they are and we can actually 
observe how they are working on our 

248
00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:10.432
images. 
So see you on the next video. 

249
00:19:10.432 --> 00:19:11.080
Thank you.
