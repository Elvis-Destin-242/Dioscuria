00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.618
Hello and welcome back to our image and 
video processing class. 

2
00:00:03.618 --> 00:00:07.352
In the previous video, we saw in real 
time, histogram equalization. 

3
00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:12.119
We saw how it improves the image and how 
we managed to get a non-uniform histogram 

4
00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.140
and make it a uniform histogram. 
So, let's see in detail how we do that. 

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.505
I'm going to show you exactly the math 
behind that and you will see how simple 

6
00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:23.090
it is. 
You would be able to go right away and 

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.249
program that in your own computer if you 
wish to do so. 

8
00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.986
So, let's just dive into it. 
So, first of all, let's just go again and 

9
00:00:30.986 --> 00:00:35.317
talk about histograms. 
Here we see a very dark image and here we 

10
00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:39.377
see the histogram. 
As we see most of the distribution of the 

11
00:00:39.377 --> 00:00:44.858
pixels value, of the pixel values are in 
the low end of the histogram, there's not 

12
00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:50.001
a lot of bright values and we see that 
the histogram basically, they are, the 

13
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:55.265
count of pixels there is very, very low. 
Here, we see the other way around, a very 

14
00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:59.990
bright image and most of the count is in 
the high part of the histogram. 

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.140
So, there is not a lot of pixels with low 
values. 

16
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.672
Here, we see kind of a great low contrast 
image and then we see that the pixels are 

17
00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:13.605
actually concentrated in the middle, 
while here, we see an image that looks 

18
00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:17.071
much nicer. 
These are all the same images, this looks 

19
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:20.404
much nicer and we have kind of a uniform 
distribution. 

20
00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:25.736
We're occupying the whole space of pixel 
values, more or less uniformly, and then 

21
00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:30.540
the image looks much, much nicer. 
So, we want to be able to learn how to go 

22
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.317
from a distribution like this to a 
distribution like this. 

23
00:01:34.317 --> 00:01:39.202
And again, as I say, it's a very, very 
simple operation, as we're going to see 

24
00:01:39.202 --> 00:01:43.573
in just a minute. 
So, our goal is to draw form a given 

25
00:01:43.573 --> 00:01:50.552
distribution to a uniform distribution 
assuming that our pixel values can go 

26
00:01:50.552 --> 00:01:55.900
from zero to L minus 1. 
For example, standard L is 256, so we can 

27
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.070
go from zero dark to 255 very bright or 
white. 

28
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.366
And we want to get a uniform 
distribution. 

29
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:08.639
So, basically, the probability or if we 
don't normalize the count, 

30
00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.430
but let's just think normalize is just 
easier, 

31
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.033
the probability is one over L minus 1. 
That's basically the probability of 

32
00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:24.372
having a pixel achieve that gray value. 
So, we want to go from this to this. 

33
00:02:24.372 --> 00:02:30.399
That's basically our goal. 
In order to achieve that, what we needs 

34
00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:36.475
to find a transform that takes basically 
the pixel values of the original image 

35
00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:40.858
and transforms them to pixel values of a 
different image. 

36
00:02:40.858 --> 00:02:49.874
So, having an image and you'd basically 
to decide, for every pixel in the image, 

37
00:02:49.874 --> 00:02:55.342
I want to see its value and I want to 
transform it to exactly the same place 

38
00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:59.548
but with a new value. 
And remember, so far, we are only making 

39
00:02:59.548 --> 00:03:03.684
decisions based on the pixel value. 
Not on the neighborhood, 

40
00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:07.610
just on the values. 
If the value is seven, we need to decid 

41
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.200
what we transform seven to regardless of 
what are the pixel values around it. 

42
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.096
So, we need a transform that takes us 
from any pixel value to a new pixel value 

43
00:03:19.096 --> 00:03:22.470
in such a way that we get a uniform 
distribution. 

44
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.590
There is going to be one requirement of 
this transform and we are going to make 

45
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.455
an increase in transform and the reason 
is we don't want to reverse the pixel 

46
00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:35.080
values. 
So, we want this to be a monotonic 

47
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.985
increasing transform. 
If seven goes to ten, eight should go to 

48
00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:44.234
a value at least ten, may be above ten. 
But we don't want it to go below ten and 

49
00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:49.611
then we actually kind of flip the content 
of the image and that's not the intention 

50
00:03:49.611 --> 00:03:53.580
of histogram equalization. 
So, we are going to have increase in 

51
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.087
functions and finding these functions is 
our goal. 

52
00:03:57.087 --> 00:04:02.629
Now, sometimes we have strictly monotonic 
increasing functions that every pixel 

53
00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.610
values goes to a different pixel value. 
Sometimes, we have an increasing function 

54
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.935
that is monotonic that some of the pixel 
value might end up with the same target. 

55
00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:17.490
And we would see that that will happen in 
histogram equalization. 

56
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.558
In particular, when we work with these 
great images and its great pixel values. 

57
00:04:22.558 --> 00:04:26.728
So, we are going to end up with a 
transform of this style and not to 

58
00:04:26.728 --> 00:04:31.797
transform of this style. 
That's basically a problem with histogram 

59
00:04:31.797 --> 00:04:37.378
equalization in this [UNKNOWN] computers, 
something that we must have, we cannot 

60
00:04:37.378 --> 00:04:42.001
avoid, as we're going to see in the next. 
So, how do we achieve this? 

61
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:47.878
The basic idea is very simple. 
We can think about an histogram as 

62
00:04:47.878 --> 00:04:53.689
basically a distribution s. 
So, this is where you need a little bit 

63
00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:58.038
of background in probability. 
But don't worry because even if you don't 

64
00:04:58.038 --> 00:05:02.694
have that background, I think it's going 
to be almost self ex, self-explanatory, 

65
00:05:02.694 --> 00:05:05.328
what I show next. 
So, we have a distribution. 

66
00:05:05.328 --> 00:05:08.391
The histogram is nothing else than a 
distribution. 

67
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:11.210
What's the probability of a given pixel 
value? 

68
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.370
We have, we now want to obtain a new one. 
We actually have the current one. 

69
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.758
So basically, we have a new, a different 
distribution. 

70
00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:27.036
And remember, what we are looking is for 
a map from r to s. 

71
00:05:27.036 --> 00:05:33.343
We are looking for this transform. 
So, it turns out, this is a basic result 

72
00:05:33.343 --> 00:05:40.081
of probability that if we have such a 
map, then the relationship between these, 

73
00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:47.784
to this division, is as follows. 
This is the relationship. 

74
00:05:47.784 --> 00:05:53.100
So, the new probability distribution is 
the old probability distribution times 

75
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.940
the absolute value of these derivative. 
That's a well-known result from 

76
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.188
probability distribution and it's what 
you need to understand the rest of the 

77
00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:06.733
derivation. 
So, let us assume, for a second, and I'm 

78
00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:11.163
going to prove you that this is the 
transform the we're looking for. 

79
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:14.640
Let's assume for a second that this is my 
transform. 

80
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.668
So, s is a transform. 
So, from any pixel value, I will get a 

81
00:06:19.668 --> 00:06:25.445
new pixel value. 
And let's write it as L minus one times 

82
00:06:25.445 --> 00:06:30.793
the integral from zero to r. 
And I'm going to explain the actual 

83
00:06:30.793 --> 00:06:37.367
interpretation of what I'm writing in a 
second of the current histogram or 

84
00:06:37.367 --> 00:06:41.637
current probability distribution, 
P(w)dw. 

85
00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:46.903
So, what am I doing here? 
I'm basically integrating the mass, the 

86
00:06:46.903 --> 00:06:52.252
number of pixels that achieve a given 
gray value from zero to r. 

87
00:06:52.252 --> 00:06:58.186
And then, I'm doing this because I'm 
using probability functions, so I'm 

88
00:06:58.186 --> 00:07:03.619
normalized between zero and one, and I 
want to get back gray values. 

89
00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:10.054
So, let's look again at the transform. 
You count, if we are in a discrete space, 

90
00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:16.283
your going to count, if you want to know 
to which pixel value should I transform 

91
00:07:16.283 --> 00:07:21.487
the value r equals seven, 
you count how many pixels are at zero, 

92
00:07:21.487 --> 00:07:27.929
how many at one, at two, and three, and 
so on until seven and that gives you the 

93
00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:32.059
transform. 
I have to prove to you that this is the 

94
00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:34.867
right transform to do histogram 
equalization. 

95
00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:39.492
So, let us do that. 
In order to do that, I'm going to compute 

96
00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:43.622
this derivative. 
And the basic idea is very simple. 

97
00:07:43.622 --> 00:07:51.341
So, we are going to actually do ds/dr. 
Now, we have the explicit transform here, 

98
00:07:51.341 --> 00:08:00.605
so we can compute this derivative. 
It's basically d of T(r)/dr and we have 

99
00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:07.709
here the expression, so it's the 
derivative according to r of this 

100
00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:18.363
expression that we have here, 
L minus 1 times the integral from zero to 

101
00:08:18.363 --> 00:08:25.257
r, 
Pr(w)dw. I apologize that the lines, that 

102
00:08:25.257 --> 00:08:31.352
rows are going one on top of the other, 
but I think it's very clear. 

103
00:08:31.352 --> 00:08:38.448
So, we need to compute this derivative 
and if you remember basic Calculus, this 

104
00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:41.814
is a constant so it will go out, 
okay? 

105
00:08:41.814 --> 00:08:48.273
And then, the derivative of this integral 
is what's inside the integral. 

106
00:08:48.273 --> 00:08:58.599
So, this is equal to L minus one times 
and I'm going to write this here in the 

107
00:08:58.599 --> 00:08:59.760
next line, 
Pr(r). 

108
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:09.488
So, we obtain that the derivative of s 
according to r is L minus one times the 

109
00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:13.370
probability, basically, the original 
histogram. 

110
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.834
Now, what we are going to do, 
I'm going to erase this in a second but 

111
00:09:17.834 --> 00:09:23.090
what we are going to do is basically 
include this here and see what happens. 

112
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:29.102
So, I'm going to plug this in here but 
look what we have here, we have dr/ds and 

113
00:09:29.102 --> 00:09:29.858
I have here. 
ds/dr. 

114
00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:33.890
S,o we need to invert that, it would be 
one over this. 

115
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:39.434
And I hope that you can see what's going 
to happen, so let's see actually what's 

116
00:09:39.434 --> 00:09:45.860
going to happen. 
Again, we have P, 

117
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:51.720
the new probability that we are looking 
is the old probability, 

118
00:09:51.720 --> 00:10:00.543
dr/ds, absolute value. 
We computed dr/ds just a second ago. 

119
00:10:00.543 --> 00:10:11.292
So, this is the Pr(r), absolute value of 
one over L minus 1, that was our 

120
00:10:11.292 --> 00:10:17.802
normalization, Pr(r). 
Now, probabilities are positive and this 

121
00:10:17.802 --> 00:10:22.809
is positive, certainly positive because L 
is greater than one. 

122
00:10:22.809 --> 00:10:29.292
So, I can get rid of the absolute value 
and then I see that this will basically 

123
00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:35.530
cancel with this and I've got one over L 
minus 1 and that's exactly what I wanted. 

124
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:41.348
Exactly what I wanted is to have a 
uniform, a constant probability 

125
00:10:41.348 --> 00:10:46.840
distribution for my new image, 
okay? So, once again, I'm going to write 

126
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.610
again what's actually the, the actual 
transform is, 

127
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:59.920
which is a map of r is L minus 1, 
the integral from zero to r of the 

128
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.688
original probability distribution of 
function or histogram. 

129
00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:10.904
So, it's a very simple function. 
You go and you count how many pixels have 

130
00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:14.480
a value up to r and that's your 
transform. 

131
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.100
Very, very simple operation. 
It's basically a one-line code in almost 

132
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.208
any programming language. 
And that will achieve us histogram 

133
00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:28.700
equalization. 
So, let's see this in action. 

134
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:36.632
First, let's just take a, basically, an 
artificial sample, where we have eight 

135
00:11:36.632 --> 00:11:42.422
different values here. 
This is a counting, so we have 790 pixels 

136
00:11:42.422 --> 00:11:47.324
that have value zero. 
And 1,023 pixels that have value one, and 

137
00:11:47.324 --> 00:11:53.113
so on, and we just transformed these into 
a probability, and because we have been 

138
00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:58.902
working with probabilities and this is 
the probability that we are going to get, 

139
00:11:58.902 --> 00:12:04.835
we plug that into the formula that I just 
showed you, and this is what we're going 

140
00:12:04.835 --> 00:12:06.500
to get. 
So, first of all. 

141
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.642
This is the original instagram, Pr. 
This is the distribution that we have. 

142
00:12:11.642 --> 00:12:16.856
If you plug that into the formula which I 
showed, this is going to be the 

143
00:12:16.856 --> 00:12:19.855
transform. 
Note, it's going to be monotonic. 

144
00:12:19.855 --> 00:12:22.998
And we know that because we are 
integrating. 

145
00:12:22.998 --> 00:12:28.354
And let me just write that again. 
The basic operation was to integrate from 

146
00:12:28.354 --> 00:12:31.854
zero to r. 
So, the more I integrate, because what I 

147
00:12:31.854 --> 00:12:36.330
have in here is positive, it's clearly an 
increasing function. 

148
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:41.030
I'm only adding more and more positive 
numbers so it has to be positive. 

149
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:46.166
So, it's an increasing function, and what 
it tells me, it tells me that zero goes 

150
00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:49.353
to this number. 
One goes to this number, and so on. 

151
00:12:49.353 --> 00:12:53.839
So, it becomes a very, very simple map. 
And this is going to be the new 

152
00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.734
histogram. 
Now, you may wonder, it looks more 

153
00:12:56.734 --> 00:13:01.562
uniform and one of the things that 
happens because we are working with 

154
00:13:01.562 --> 00:13:06.731
discrete data, we're working with images 
in the computer, we're going to have to 

155
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:10.063
round numbers. 
So, for example, the 4.2 will become 

156
00:13:10.063 --> 00:13:13.010
four. 
So, we end up actually with less peaks 

157
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:18.538
than we have here because this ones here 
at the end, will merge into the same 

158
00:13:18.538 --> 00:13:22.342
integer number. 
And that's a price we play, we pay for 

159
00:13:22.342 --> 00:13:28.946
working with this great images. 
We cannot represent 6.7 and 6.8, will 

160
00:13:28.946 --> 00:13:34.546
both become, although the formula tells 
us they should go to different numbers, 

161
00:13:34.546 --> 00:13:39.858
they will both become, let's say, seven. 
In a similar fashion, Let me ask the 

162
00:13:39.858 --> 00:13:44.955
following question which I'm going to ask 
you to think for a second and then 

163
00:13:44.955 --> 00:13:49.637
respond to me. 
Let's just look at an histogram that has 

164
00:13:49.637 --> 00:13:55.460
the following form. 
It has only two different pixel values, 

165
00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.428
these two. 
It doesn't matter what exactly are the 

166
00:14:00.428 --> 00:14:05.393
values here, but this is the original 
distribution, of pixel values. 

167
00:14:05.393 --> 00:14:11.111
There are only two values in the image. 
This is a binary image with only two 

168
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:14.421
different colors, two different pixel 
values. 

169
00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:19.988
And I'm going to ask you what's the 
relationship between the map for a pixel 

170
00:14:19.988 --> 00:14:25.329
value here and a pixel value here? 
So, let's just call this A, let's just 

171
00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:30.723
call this B, and I'm asking you the 
relationship between T(a) and T(b). 

172
00:14:30.723 --> 00:14:33.575
Are they equal? 
Are they different? 

173
00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:37.014
Is T(a) greater than T(b)? Is T(a) less 
than T(b)? 

174
00:14:37.014 --> 00:14:43.305
So, just think for a second and give me 
your answer and I'm going to come back 

175
00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:48.590
right away and give you the explanation 
for the correct answer. 

176
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.195
So, let's look at what is the correct 
answer. 

177
00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:58.340
Remember, what we are doing in histogram 
equalization is we are integrating, 

178
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.781
okay? 
So, I ask you, what's the relationship 

179
00:15:01.781 --> 00:15:05.386
between these two, are equal, less, or 
greater? 

180
00:15:05.386 --> 00:15:11.532
We know first of all that T(b) should be 
greater or equal, than T(a) because we 

181
00:15:11.532 --> 00:15:17.513
have a monotonically increase in 
function. But let's just look a bit more 

182
00:15:17.513 --> 00:15:23.065
in detail, what happened. 
This actually is going to integrate the 

183
00:15:23.065 --> 00:15:28.020
whole mass up to here. 
So, basically its going to integrate only 

184
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.638
this. 
Here, is going to integrate everything up 

185
00:15:31.638 --> 00:15:35.255
to b. 
But there is no new mass between a and b. 

186
00:15:35.255 --> 00:15:43.840
Since there is no new mass then what 
happens is that T(a) would equal to T(b). 

187
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.838
And as an extra exercise, you can think 
about what's going to be actually to 

188
00:15:48.838 --> 00:15:53.899
transform for this one and what's going 
to be the transform for this particular 

189
00:15:53.899 --> 00:15:56.430
one. 
And especially, you can relate it to the 

190
00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.289
average in the image, just do that as an 
exercise on the side. 

191
00:16:00.289 --> 00:16:05.097
But this is very important illustration 
that the basically, transform that we're 

192
00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:10.159
looking for, even before we have to round 
or quantize because we're working with 

193
00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:13.575
these great images. 
Even before that, it's not strictly 

194
00:16:13.575 --> 00:16:18.359
monotonic, there might be more than one 
values that end up with the same 

195
00:16:18.359 --> 00:16:21.820
transform. 
You can, of course, say, we don't really 

196
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.660
care too much about that, because in the 
original image there were no pixels with 

197
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.670
initial gray value a. 
And that's correct but I want to show 

198
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.880
this both to illustrate that the 
transform does not have to be 

199
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.088
monotonically, strictly monotonically 
increasing. 

200
00:16:39.088 --> 00:16:42.764
It has to be monotonically increasing but 
not strictly. 

201
00:16:42.764 --> 00:16:47.509
And also to illustrate once again that 
all what the histogram equalization is 

202
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:52.990
doing is basically counting the number of 
pixels after the value that you want to 

203
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.997
mark. 
So, I'm counting the value, the number of 

204
00:16:55.997 --> 00:16:59.540
pixels up to a and then the number of 
pixels up to b. 

205
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.443
So, after this exercise, let's just see 
few additional examples. 

206
00:17:03.443 --> 00:17:08.038
We, of course, saw examples with the 
online demo, but let's just illustrate 

207
00:17:08.038 --> 00:17:10.934
one more example, 
which I think is very useful. 

208
00:17:10.934 --> 00:17:13.767
I'm going back to the images that we 
started. 

209
00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:17.355
This was dark. 
This is what's happening after histogram 

210
00:17:17.355 --> 00:17:20.314
equalization and the histogram looks much 
nicer than before. 

211
00:17:20.314 --> 00:17:23.210
So, let's just look at the map. 
This is the map. 

212
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.019
Pixels value form here can map to here, 
okay? 

213
00:17:27.019 --> 00:17:31.609
So, this is my r and this is my s. 
And look at the map. 

214
00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:38.449
The map is basically is very, it has a 
very, very high slope because it's trying 

215
00:17:38.449 --> 00:17:43.039
to very fast map very dark pixels to 
brighter pixels. 

216
00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:49.013
So, it has a very, very sharp slope. 
Let's look for example at this one. 

217
00:17:49.013 --> 00:17:56.027
This one was pretty good to start from. 
It hasn't changed a lot and actually this 

218
00:17:56.027 --> 00:18:00.697
is the map. 
It's almost unislope, in mapping the 

219
00:18:00.697 --> 00:18:04.846
diagonal, there's almost no changes in 
the pixel values. 

220
00:18:04.846 --> 00:18:08.693
And similar interpretations for the other 
two maps. 

221
00:18:08.693 --> 00:18:14.351
This one actually needed, needs to darken 
the pixels and we see that in the 

222
00:18:14.351 --> 00:18:18.500
corresponding map, that basically, look 
what happens here. 

223
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.706
And this one needed to stretch the 
pixels. 

224
00:18:21.706 --> 00:18:27.098
Remember, they were in the middle, it 
needs to stretch them and we actually 

225
00:18:27.098 --> 00:18:31.543
observe that here. 
It's stretching the pixels from the 

226
00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:34.967
middle. 
They were all around here to start from 

227
00:18:34.967 --> 00:18:41.015
and it's going to stretch them and we see 
that it actually occupies the whole range 

228
00:18:41.015 --> 00:18:46.380
from this which was the very big, very 
narrow band, that it occupies the 

229
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:52.367
original histogram with very low contrast 
is actually mapping out to the whole 

230
00:18:52.367 --> 00:18:56.989
spectrum from zero to 255 and we see that 
in the map as well. 

231
00:18:56.989 --> 00:19:02.444
And, of course, we end up with images 
that are very similar, regardless of 

232
00:19:02.444 --> 00:19:08.285
where we started because these images 
actually were created from these images, 

233
00:19:08.285 --> 00:19:12.011
from an original, 
let's say, this one, just by changing the 

234
00:19:12.011 --> 00:19:16.130
contrast. And then after we equalize 
them, they look much closer. 

235
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:21.360
And that's a technique that is used very 
often to make images that we're taking 

236
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.628
under different conditions look much more 
similar. 

237
00:19:24.628 --> 00:19:29.662
We equalize the histogram, at the same 
time, we're making the images look much 

238
00:19:29.662 --> 00:19:34.238
more similar and then we can compare 
between them in a, in a much more 

239
00:19:34.238 --> 00:19:37.142
friendly fashion. 
So, this is basically instagram 

240
00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:40.265
equalization. 
What we are going to do next in the next 

241
00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:44.428
video is instagram transform. 
What happens if I don't want to equalize 

242
00:19:44.428 --> 00:19:47.435
an histogram? 
I want to transform it to an histogram 

243
00:19:47.435 --> 00:19:50.384
that I know is going to be very good for 
my image. 

244
00:19:50.384 --> 00:19:54.778
We are going to see that in the next very 
short video that is also a very, very 

245
00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.340
simple operation. 
Thank you.
