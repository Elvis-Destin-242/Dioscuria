00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.016
Exploiting MATLAB once again, we're going 
to illustrate an example of median 

2
00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:09.412
filter. 
So we're creating three images now. 

3
00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:14.537
Image I is the original image, 
we're going to see it in a second. 

4
00:00:14.537 --> 00:00:19.502
Image J is this image, but we have added 
salt and pepper noise. 

5
00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:25.748
That's basically strong noise as we're 
going to observe soon, that is dark and 

6
00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:29.832
white pixels. 
And image K is going to be the median 

7
00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:35.598
filter operation on the noisy image. 
And I'm going to show you I, J, and K. 

8
00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:39.840
So let's see that. 
We have three images. 

9
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.979
This figure is the original image, 
this is the one with salt and pepper 

10
00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.147
noise. 
We see these black pixels, so basic 

11
00:00:50.147 --> 00:00:55.480
pixels were completely changed their 
pixel value to, from white to black. 

12
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.360
And here, we see the result of median 
filtering, 

13
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.391
which is I think very impressive for such 
a simple filter. 

14
00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:05.936
It got completely rid of all the noise 
that we had. 

15
00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:11.497
It does blur a bit the image as we know 
the actual data, as we know from when we 

16
00:01:11.497 --> 00:01:14.486
learned the operation of the median 
filter. 

17
00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:19.908
But it did manage to get rid of the noise 
and provide us a much more pleasant 

18
00:01:19.908 --> 00:01:22.549
image. 
So, this is an example of median 

19
00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.901
filtering operating inside MATLAB and 
with some of the images that come with 

20
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:32.003
the MATLAB package. 
Thank you, and see you in the next video.
