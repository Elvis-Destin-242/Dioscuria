00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.174
Hello and welcome back. 
We're almost at the end of our Week 3 and 

2
00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:11.098
I want to conclude the technical content 
of this week with some brief comments 

3
00:00:11.098 --> 00:00:17.172
about gradients and about edges and about 
gradients in high dimensions basically 

4
00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:21.296
for color images. 
So, the topic of this relatively short 

5
00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:25.270
video is gradients. 
And we see here, age detection and 

6
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.420
coloration detection because that's what 
they are related to for image processing. 

7
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.799
So, the basic idea is very simple and you 
have learn about gradients probably in 

8
00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:42.503
your Calculus classes, maybe recently, 
maybe a long time ago. 

9
00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:46.650
And what I want to talk with you is about 
gradients. 

10
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.083
The gradient of an image F is actually a 
vector. 

11
00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:57.340
An image is a scalar. At every point we 
have a value. 

12
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.908
The gradient is actually a vector. 
It's the derivative of F in the x 

13
00:01:02.908 --> 00:01:09.803
direction, that's one coordinate of the 
vector and the derivative of F in the y 

14
00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.723
direction. 
That's the other coordinate of the 

15
00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:15.902
vector. 
We have already seen that derivatives are 

16
00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:19.276
very important. 
They actually led us to detect edges. 

17
00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:22.131
They led us to detect big changes in 
images. 

18
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:27.452
We have seen that and we remember that as 
well from our early classes in Calculus. 

19
00:01:27.452 --> 00:01:32.911
If we have a step, basically, a sharp 
change that the derivative of that is the 

20
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:38.274
delta function, so it helps you to detect 
those edges and with unsharp masking 

21
00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:43.996
[UNKNOWN] techniques will help us to 
enhance images that may be a blur or may 

22
00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:49.360
be which we just want to enhance their 
edges so we can observe them better. 

23
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.185
Now, the gradient is one important 
derivative and one of the important 

24
00:01:55.185 --> 00:02:01.094
characteristics, in case you don't 
remember that from your earlier class, 

25
00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:04.980
classes, 
is that when you see at the certain pixel 

26
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.689
in the image and you ask yourself, in 
which direction is my image changing the 

27
00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:16.252
most?" So, in which direction should I 
make a walk, a step, and I get a big jump 

28
00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:21.522
in the pixel values of my image? 
It turns out that that direction is the 

29
00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:24.889
gradient. 
So, when you're saying, for example, this 

30
00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.597
is an object., 
And you say, which way should I go" to 

31
00:02:28.597 --> 00:02:32.348
have the maximal change in my pixel 
value? 

32
00:02:32.348 --> 00:02:38.598
That is the gradient direction. 
This gives you the direction of the 

33
00:02:38.598 --> 00:02:44.670
maximal change in your image. 
So, it's a very, very interesting object. 

34
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.929
How much are you changing? 
That's what's called the absolute value 

35
00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:54.472
of the gradient. 
So, the absolute value of the gradient of 

36
00:02:54.472 --> 00:03:00.688
F, that's basically the definition of the 
absolute value or the magnitude of a 

37
00:03:00.688 --> 00:03:06.904
vector. 
Just a square root of the square of the 

38
00:03:06.904 --> 00:03:13.593
derivative in the x direction and the 
square of the derivative in the y 

39
00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:16.781
direction. 
That's how much you're actually jumping, 

40
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:21.499
how much you are changing the gray value 
when you advance in the gradient 

41
00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.432
direction. 
In any other direction, you're going to 

42
00:03:24.432 --> 00:03:27.110
be changing equal or less than that 
value. 

43
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.828
In particular, there is one direction 
that you're not going to be changing at 

44
00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:35.590
all, and that's the direction 
perpendicular to the gradient. 

45
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.612
If your moving the gradient direction, 
you have the highest jump. 

46
00:03:39.612 --> 00:03:43.697
If you move perpendicular to it, you have 
the lowest jump, actually zero. 

47
00:03:43.697 --> 00:03:48.851
That's called the lever's edge and we're 
going to talk much more about that in a 

48
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:52.114
few weeks. 
So, this is the concept of gradient. 

49
00:03:52.114 --> 00:03:57.758
You compute the derivatives, you compute 
the magnitude, and you're going to get 

50
00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:03.553
basically, the amount of jump when you go 
from one pixel to just the neighbor 

51
00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:07.678
pixels. 
Now, this whole concept also exists for 

52
00:04:07.678 --> 00:04:12.477
vector images. 
So, instead of having just one image, I 

53
00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:20.174
have an RGB image, a polar image. 
Now, at every point, I have three values 

54
00:04:20.174 --> 00:04:26.391
and I can ask the same question, in which 
direction do I have the maximal change of 

55
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:31.934
these three values at the same time? 
You could actually ask for each value 

56
00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:35.830
independently. 
You could say, in which direction does 

57
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.010
the red changed the most, in which 
direction the green, in which direction 

58
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.977
the blue, and that's very simple, very 
simply three gradient directions. 

59
00:04:45.977 --> 00:04:51.157
You're going to get three different 
directions sometimes, or you could say, I 

60
00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:56.764
want them to change at the same time. 
In which one of the directions I have the 

61
00:04:56.764 --> 00:05:01.032
biggest change as a vector? 
At the same time, red, green, and blue, 

62
00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:05.607
when I basically accumulate the change is 
the maximal possible change. 

63
00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:10.313
And that concept also exist is the 
concept of the gradient of factorial 

64
00:05:10.313 --> 00:05:15.084
images is not very hard to compute, but 
we're going to skip that for now, but 

65
00:05:15.084 --> 00:05:19.921
you're also going to get that direction 
and there's going to be a close formula, 

66
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:24.692
like we have here, that tells you in 
which direction you have the maximal 

67
00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:27.530
change in the vector, in the whole 
colors. 

68
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.360
You're going to have, once again, a 
direction, and once again, a maximal 

69
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.440
value. 
That basically is an extension of the 

70
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.220
concept of gradient for vector images 
like RGB images. 

71
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.230
So, I wanted you to know about that 
concept. 

72
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.690
I wanted you to know about the concept of 
gradients and the concept of vector 

73
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.110
gradients. 
And what we are going to do, is in the 

74
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.862
next video, we're going to conclude this 
very, very useful week that we had. 

75
00:05:56.862 --> 00:05:57.640
Thank you.
