Thank you very much for spending this week with me. 
I think we have learned a lot, we learned a lot of very important basic concepts on 
image enhancement. And next week we are going to learn even 
more and we are getting close to the end of the first half of this class which is 
basically the basic fundamental the mentioned concepts. 
And as we talk earlier, the second half will be about more advanced topics in 
image processing. For those that are interested, we are 
going to conclude this week with some hints in my board that I left you to 
prove what we saw in the previous video about gradients, and what's a gradient? 
What that it means to go in a gradient. What is the direction of maximal change? 
So if you can sneak in the back, and actually have half of the proof there. 
That's unnecessary for you to keep understanding what's going to happen in 
the next six weeks. This is only if you're super curious 
about that concept. Thank you very much. 
It's very dark here. It's night at Duke University and I'm 
going to see you again next week. Thank you. 
Bye-bye.
