00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.578
We are now inside a MATLAB environment. 
And we are going to be using MATLAB to 

2
00:00:04.578 --> 00:00:09.096
illustrate some of these picture 
modification, algorithm we just described 

3
00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:12.698
and also some those are we are going to 
see in the next video. 

4
00:00:12.698 --> 00:00:15.751
MATLAB is a great software to do image 
processing. 

5
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:20.513
Of course, you don't need to have MATLAB 
to understand what I'm, going to show you 

6
00:00:20.513 --> 00:00:23.932
next or you don't need to know how to 
program in MATLAB. 

7
00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:28.511
It's very intuitive and it's going to be 
very simple for us to understand the 

8
00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:33.045
commands that I'm going to do. 
The first command, is basically reading 

9
00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:36.670
an image. 
As we see here, we are reading the image. 

10
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.431
The next command is going to have a 
number of steps, which I'm going to show 

11
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.438
you next. 
I'm going to first, create a figure and 

12
00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:48.698
show the image in that figure. 
Then I create a second figure, and I'm 

13
00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:51.580
going to show you the histogram of that 
image. 

14
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.990
And I'm going to keep creating figures to 
illustrate the other operations, I want 

15
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.530
to show you. 
One of them is going to be the inversion 

16
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.333
of that image, 
255 minus I. 

17
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:07.209
And the last thing I want to show you is 
the histogram of that image. 

18
00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:12.152
You can start thinking, how the histogram 
of the inversion compares to the 

19
00:01:12.152 --> 00:01:15.291
histogram of the original image. 
Let's see that., 

20
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:20.434
let's just show all those figures, one 
after the other, I'm going to move them, 

21
00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:24.910
so it makes it easier for us to observe 
those images, those figures. 

22
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.594
And I'm going to tell you what each one 
of them is. 

23
00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:32.640
So here is the original image. 
And this is its histogram. 

24
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.130
And we see the image is pretty dark, so 
we see a large concentration of dark 

25
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.164
values. 
Here is the inversion of the image. 

26
00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:44.487
We basically have flip all of image 
values. 

27
00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:49.906
And look what happened to the histogram. 
The histogram also has flip. 

28
00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:54.218
Basically, what was here, 
it moved to here as we have expected 

29
00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:59.723
because we are just flipping the pixels 
we are not making any other change but 

30
00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:04.252
flipping the pixel values. 
So it's a very simple operation and we 

31
00:02:04.252 --> 00:02:09.626
see what's happening to the histogram. 
Let's now see another operation that we 

32
00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:12.947
are going to describe in detail in the 
next video. 

33
00:02:12.947 --> 00:02:16.800
And it's going to be an what's called 
histogram equalization. 

34
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.848
I'm going to look for the command to do 
the histogram equalization and to show 

35
00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:24.305
that to you. 
And that's going to be here. 

36
00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:28.822
Once again, I'm going to show you the 
image and its histogram as before. 

37
00:02:28.822 --> 00:02:33.671
Now I'm going to show you the equalized 
image and I'm going to illustrate what 

38
00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:37.988
that means and also the histogram. 
So again we're going to have four 

39
00:02:37.988 --> 00:02:41.451
figures. 
And, I think that you are starting to 

40
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:46.601
guess what's happening here. 
As before, we have the original image, 

41
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:51.830
it's historgram We see the histogram very 
concentrated on the left. 

42
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.627
Here we have the result what's called 
histogram equalization. 

43
00:02:56.627 --> 00:03:02.527
What we are trying to do here is to make 
this histogram looks more uniform. 

44
00:03:02.527 --> 00:03:08.268
Look at here, how instead of being 
concentrated in the low values, showing 

45
00:03:08.268 --> 00:03:13.932
that this is a very dark image. 
We spread the pixel's values so there is 

46
00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:18.966
better exploitation of all the gamut of 
values from zero to 256. 

47
00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:24.000
Instead of here that there was almost no 
pixels with this value. 

48
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.900
That is to come equalization help us to 
see details that we couldn't see before 

49
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.131
like this region of the tire. 
So it's a very powerful operation to be 

50
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:41.158
able to basically see details in the 
image that because of the bad use of the 

51
00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:44.791
spectrum of grey values we couldn't see 
before. 

52
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:50.046
What we're going to see next is how we 
actually mathematically do this 

53
00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:53.060
operation. 
So, see you in the next video.
