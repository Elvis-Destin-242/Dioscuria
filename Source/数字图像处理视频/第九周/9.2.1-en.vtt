00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.211
Hello and welcome back. In this video
we're going to be talking about image

2
00:00:05.223 --> 00:00:10.450
processing in a very particular
application, medical imaging. And this is

3
00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:16.391
image processing for virus understanding.
And in particular to understand the shape

4
00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:22.495
of the HIV virus. This actually brings a
lot of challenges, as we are going to see.

5
00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:29.015
We're going to have to talk about many,
many topics in image processing including

6
00:00:29.027 --> 00:00:35.150
image acquisition and let's start with
that. There are many ways to acquire

7
00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:41.941
images. And before we do that, we have to
understand. One of the basic things is the

8
00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:48.689
size of the structure that we're trying to
acquire. And here we see a scale of very

9
00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:55.845
different structures. depending on what
this type we want to acquire what type of

10
00:00:55.857 --> 00:01:01.556
technology, we're are going to be using to
acquire that data? And of course, we are

11
00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:07.115
used to light, we are used to cameras.
Basically, light reflecting from objects

12
00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:12.135
and then giving us a picture. But
depending on the size of the objects and

13
00:01:12.147 --> 00:01:18.656
their scale, we might need different
modities for image accusition. During this

14
00:01:18.668 --> 00:01:24.797
video we are interested in viruses and
then we are going to be talking about

15
00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:31.217
nanometers or angstroms scale and in
particular what we are going to use is not

16
00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:39.041
light we are going to use electrons to
aquire our image because we are at a very,

17
00:01:39.053 --> 00:01:45.886
very small scale. Again, in the orders of
nanometers and angstroms. Now, let me just

18
00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:51.928
tell you why we are interested in
something very small in the HIV virus. And

19
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.317
I hope this diagram, although a bit
complicated. I think It illustrates a lot

20
00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.632
of the challenges that we're going to have
and why is this so important what I'm

21
00:02:04.644 --> 00:02:11.154
going to explain next. So here we have an
HIV virus. Remember we're talking again

22
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:17.030
maybe 100 angstrom, you know just very,
very small structures. And here basically,

23
00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:25.024
we have the host set. So basically, the
virus is trying to latch into this host,

24
00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:33.014
and in order to do that, it uses things
here which are called envelop or spikes.

25
00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:41.251
And then they go and try to latch here as
showin in this diagram. And then basically

26
00:02:41.263 --> 00:02:47.388
transmission foes into the host's cell. So
we're interested in this virus and in

27
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.030
particular this might surprise you, and it
will surprise you even more when you see

28
00:02:54.042 --> 00:03:01.004
the images. We are interested in these
basically, these envelopes or spikes.

29
00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:08.556
They're called envelopes, and often,
they're just read as ENV. And, once again,

30
00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:16.727
because that's what the HIV is using to
latch itself into the membrane of the host

31
00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:24.725
cell and if we understand that structure,
we might be able to stop and to block that

32
00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:31.495
connection and hopefully stop
transmission. That's what we want to get.

33
00:03:31.627 --> 00:03:37.765
Now we are at those small scales,
remember. And then what we need to use is

34
00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:44.320
not light. We won't be able with light to
get to that scale. We use electrons and

35
00:03:44.332 --> 00:03:50.547
here is a diagram. Now once again your use
to basically light. So light comes,

36
00:03:50.672 --> 00:03:56.818
reflects in objects like me and then
regular cameras like the video camera that

37
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.750
is recording right now, captures the
reflection. In transmission electron

38
00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:08.772
microscopy, basically we have this
specimen we basically have. A specimen

39
00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:15.357
with HIV, for example, but other specimens
are possible as well. Microscopy is used

40
00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:21.050
all over for biological research.
Electrons basically go, it's like you

41
00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:27.170
throw electrons into the specimen and you
see, and you let them just go through.

42
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.006
Basically you capture the image, you
capture the image of the specimen by

43
00:04:33.018 --> 00:04:39.059
measuring how the electrons go through,
and we see that in this diagram. There is

44
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:44.390
a lens, and there is the image plane.
That's where things basically get

45
00:04:44.402 --> 00:04:50.685
captured. This is a picture Of this
device. The high end devices are not very

46
00:04:50.697 --> 00:04:57.640
cheap they can cost millions of dollars so
this is not something that you carry with

47
00:04:57.652 --> 00:05:04.285
you like regular digital camera. Once
again this uses electods are hiden in the

48
00:05:04.297 --> 00:05:11.133
speciman basically to go through and then
we capture it. So for us, it's a different

49
00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:17.009
way of creating images, but the important
way is that we can create images for these

50
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:23.068
particles that are very, very, very, very
small. So that's electron microscopy. And

51
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.116
here is an image of what you will get from
electron microscopy. Now remember, have

52
00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:35.415
always in mind, this is what we saw in the
previous diagram. This is what we are

53
00:05:35.427 --> 00:05:42.094
looking for. One projection of that. So
you took this electron microscopy and you

54
00:05:42.106 --> 00:05:48.423
basically threw electrons and you one
projection of that. And that's basically

55
00:05:48.435 --> 00:05:53.895
what you have here so this, is this.
Doesn't look very nice but we are going to

56
00:05:53.907 --> 00:06:00.071
have to deal with that and we are actually
going to change the molality a little bit

57
00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:05.605
but it's not that it doesn't look very
nice because the instrument isn't very

58
00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:11.345
good or the person taking the image is not
Very good in doing that. This is actually

59
00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:15.915
extremely good quality for this
technology. And we need this technology

60
00:06:15.927 --> 00:06:20.915
because we want to get these very tiny,
very, very tiny elements. So we are going

61
00:06:20.552 --> 00:06:25.450
to have to deal with this. Before I do
that, before I show you how to do that

62
00:06:25.472 --> 00:06:31.429
This is the beauty of image processing,
that we are going to be able to deal with

63
00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:37.197
this. Let me just talk a bit more about
tomography. Instead of just taking,

64
00:06:37.322 --> 00:06:43.631
putting the specimen and just taking one
view, what, what you do in tomography is

65
00:06:43.643 --> 00:06:49.361
you rotate the specimen. So let me just
show you this here. So you have the

66
00:06:49.373 --> 00:06:55.434
specimen and then yo rotate it and you
rotate it and you take multiple images of

67
00:06:55.446 --> 00:07:01.489
this rotation and that's what's called
tomography. Now, what do I mean by cryo?

68
00:07:01.613 --> 00:07:07.718
Okay. First of all we now know what's
electron. Instead of electron microscopy

69
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:14.185
we say electron tomography because we have
multiple projections. Cryo is because,

70
00:07:14.302 --> 00:07:20.365
with the specimen, before we put here, we
freeze it at prior temperatures. Now, this

71
00:07:20.377 --> 00:07:26.340
technology helps to reduce radiation. This
is very important. When life is hitting

72
00:07:26.352 --> 00:07:32.007
me, you can take as many pictures as you
want of me. I'm not going to get hurt by

73
00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:37.221
that. When you throw electrons at the
specimen, you're hurting the specimen.

74
00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:43.093
You're changing it. So you're changing the
shape of what you're trying to understand

75
00:07:43.105 --> 00:07:48.445
the shape of, and this is very dangerous.
So this technique of cryo-electron

76
00:07:48.457 --> 00:07:53.659
tomography helps to reduce the rad iation
of that and also helps you to obtain

77
00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:59.279
3-dimension information because you have
multiple, multiple tips. So that's

78
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:04.112
basically what we do and let's see images
in a second. But we are doing

79
00:08:04.124 --> 00:08:10.604
cryo-electron tomography. This is just one
of those images. Again, remember we're

80
00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:16.917
interested in this kind of stuff. And
actually we're interested in these spikes.

81
00:08:17.043 --> 00:08:22.952
You might be able to see some of them
there. But that's what we want to get the

82
00:08:22.964 --> 00:08:29.286
3-dimensional shape of that. They're very,
very tiny and have received very, very

83
00:08:29.298 --> 00:08:35.614
noisy. So here's where you get the call to
image processing. And just to say once

84
00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:42.914
again what kind of data we have. We got
tiers. Basically we have the specimen. We

85
00:08:42.914 --> 00:08:45.814
rotate.
We throw the electrons that did, we get

86
00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:52.660
one projection. We do a different rotation
we get a different projection. A different

87
00:08:52.672 --> 00:08:58.152
rotation, a different projection. Then we
put them together and we get the three

88
00:08:58.164 --> 00:09:03.441
dimensions. So I'm going to always show
you slices of this, because, most of the

89
00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:08.983
time, I'm going to show you 3D when we get
the reconstruction. But remember, this is

90
00:09:08.995 --> 00:09:15.236
supposed to represent this. And we obtain
it so here was the specimen, very, very

91
00:09:15.248 --> 00:09:21.357
tiny, and here is the image in the
computer. Now, the image processing starts

92
00:09:21.369 --> 00:09:27.581
with putting all these projections
together to get the 3D. Normally, although

93
00:09:27.593 --> 00:09:33.260
there are alternatives, that's done with
what is called fiducials. So, you

94
00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:38.385
basically embed in this specimen gold
particles and then you have a gold

95
00:09:38.397 --> 00:09:43.800
particle, let's; say this pink and then
you know where the gold particule is in

96
00:09:43.812 --> 00:09:49.883
every single one of the projections and
then you align the images based on those

97
00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:56.537
cold particles. So you throw in a few and
you put them together and that helps you

98
00:09:56.549 --> 00:10:02.671
to stack the images and to basically get
the 3D in the computer of the real

99
00:10:02.683 --> 00:10:09.660
3-dimensional virus. Now there's one thing
I want to explain here. When you are doing

100
00:10:09.672 --> 00:10:14.120
the projection, you can see, this is very
thin. And so, I'm illustrating it much

101
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:21.284
wider. We're talking about very, very
thin. So you cryo, micro-cryo-tomography,

102
00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:27.915
cryo-microscopy, you have a very thin
slice at cryo-temperatures. So if I do the

103
00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:34.503
projection that I'm going to try to throw
electrons from here. You're not going to

104
00:10:34.515 --> 00:10:41.266
get a lot because it's very, very thick.
So look at my hand now. it's okay to have

105
00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:45.852
electrons going like this but not going
like this. Okay.

106
00:10:45.855 --> 00:10:52.945
So if I have something very, very thin I
can just do this. Remember, rotating the

107
00:10:52.957 --> 00:11:00.424
specimen is like rotating the raise. So I
can have raise here but not raise here and

108
00:11:00.436 --> 00:11:07.441
maybe also not raise there. So we actually
don't have the full 180 degrees. We

109
00:11:07.453 --> 00:11:15.043
normally, out of the 180 degrees. We might
basically miss here 30 degrees and another

110
00:11:15.055 --> 00:11:21.612
30 degrees there. And that's called a
missing wedge. As we're going to see yet

111
00:11:21.624 --> 00:11:28.444
another problem. We actually don't have
all the data we wanted to have because of

112
00:11:28.456 --> 00:11:34.920
this missing wedge. But now we are about
to get into the image processing. We

113
00:11:34.932 --> 00:11:40.884
acquired the data. We align the
projections using gold particles most of

114
00:11:40.896 --> 00:11:47.763
the time and now it's time to find those
viruses and find those envelops. Now, this

115
00:11:47.775 --> 00:11:55.281
is what you see. You have a line and this
is what you see. Remember, this is the

116
00:11:55.293 --> 00:12:03.057
schematic of what we are looking for. But
these are slices of this 3D that we just

117
00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:09.032
have done. Now do you see here the
envelopes or the spikes? No you dont see

118
00:12:09.044 --> 00:12:14.531
them. This is where we need image
processing. We have extremly noisy data

119
00:12:14.543 --> 00:12:20.223
and we have the missing wedge. We have
tons of problems.Are we going to be able

120
00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:26.192
to reconstruct these 3D. I am going to
reassure you, yes that the answer is yes

121
00:12:26.502 --> 00:12:33.738
at a certain accuracy, of course. Again,
these are just slices on the 3D volume

122
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:39.731
that was reconstructed with
cryo-tomography. This is what we have,

123
00:12:39.871 --> 00:12:47.750
this is the process that we have. We had
basically a virus or a structure inside a

124
00:12:47.762 --> 00:12:54.636
specimen. We took multiple projections.
Look how I represented here the missing

125
00:12:54.648 --> 00:13:01.096
wedge. We didn't take the whole around
projection. We basically have missing

126
00:13:01.108 --> 00:13:07.845
wedge here so we took that and we kind of
get a noisy version in this 3D volume. But

127
00:13:07.857 --> 00:13:14.145
there is 1 thing which is very important.
We get multiple copies of these, as we

128
00:13:14.157 --> 00:13:20.790
have seen. Let me show you that again. We
may have multiple copies. You see one. You

129
00:13:20.802 --> 00:13:27.155
see another one coming here. I'm going to
show you more. We have multiple copies of

130
00:13:27.167 --> 00:13:34.830
these. And we also have multiple copies of
this, and that's what we are going to

131
00:13:34.842 --> 00:13:42.565
exploit with image processing. We are
going to exploit that we have not one very

132
00:13:42.577 --> 00:13:50.250
noisy example but multiple very noisy
examples. So hopefully we can extract

133
00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:57.330
them, put them together, and get the three
dimensions that we want. Remember one

134
00:13:57.342 --> 00:14:04.205
thing, when we talk about image denoising
we already discussed that if we have

135
00:14:04.217 --> 00:14:11.405
multiple copies of the same object with
random noise added, one of the best things

136
00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:18.375
you can do for de-noising is add all those
multiple copies. If the noise has zero

137
00:14:18.387 --> 00:14:25.035
mean, and it's random, then it would just
cancel each other. That basically was the

138
00:14:25.047 --> 00:14:32.600
concept behind local means. It's also the
concept just behind local averaging. You

139
00:14:32.612 --> 00:14:38.925
basically want to average things that are
repetitions of the same and that will help

140
00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:44.790
you to eliminate the noise. Remember if
you average 10, the value of the noise

141
00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:50.085
goes down by the square of that. So a
hundred, the more you average, the more

142
00:14:50.097 --> 00:14:56.691
you manage to de-noise. So that's great
but what's the challenge here? Multiple

143
00:14:56.703 --> 00:15:03.188
challenges. These images are very noisy.
The spikes, the envelopes, here, are

144
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.685
rotated. We have to align them before we
average them otherwise it will be a mess.

145
00:15:09.814 --> 00:15:15.504
Okay, if you average this with this, you
let's say these two vectors you get

146
00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:21.407
something like this nothing to do with any
of them. So, you have to first align them

147
00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:27.277
and I am going to demonstrate that in one
of the next slides. So you have to align

148
00:15:27.289 --> 00:15:32.585
them and also are they identical copies?
Maybe there are multiple different

149
00:15:32.597 --> 00:15:38.000
structures. Maybe slightly different, but
still different. So we're going to have to

150
00:15:38.012 --> 00:15:43.155
rotate, align them, group only those that
are the same. And only after we do all

151
00:15:43.167 --> 00:15:49.457
that, then we're allowed to average. So,
here is the problem. Let me illustrate

152
00:15:49.469 --> 00:15:57.576
that to you. Let's say that we have three
things as we see here. 1, 2, 3. Now let's

153
00:15:57.588 --> 00:16:05.033
simulate cryo electron tomography for
this. We basically get multiple copies of

154
00:16:05.045 --> 00:16:10.839
each one. That's a good part. We get
multiple copies of each one, very noisy.

155
00:16:10.957 --> 00:16:16.417
Okay? That's not so good. The multiple
copies is good, the noise is not very

156
00:16:16.429 --> 00:16:21.995
good, but we have to deal with that. We
get them rotated. That's also not very

157
00:16:22.007 --> 00:16:27.922
good, but we're going to have to deal with
that. And then, we get the missing wedge.

158
00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:34.431
Okay? So and of course we don't have the
originals, this is what we have. So

159
00:16:34.443 --> 00:16:41.601
somebody gave you this, very noisy data,
with missing data, the missing wedge. They

160
00:16:41.613 --> 00:16:48.291
didn't give you in the columns, they are
all unorganized. So you have to be able,

161
00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:55.230
from them, you have to be able to group
the ones that came From basically the same

162
00:16:55.242 --> 00:17:01.802
building. Here we have to be able to group
back here. You have to rotate back and all

163
00:17:01.814 --> 00:17:08.597
that from this noisy data with a lot of
missing information. If we have 30 degrees

164
00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:15.460
missing. We have 60 degrees missing out of
180. That's a lot of missing information

165
00:17:15.472 --> 00:17:21.320
and that's represented here. So this holes
is a realistic proportion. You have this

166
00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:26.506
group aligned, do everything. And
hopefully after you're done, of course,

167
00:17:26.621 --> 00:17:32.150
you're doing all the rotations, all the
groupings and everything together.

168
00:17:32.271 --> 00:17:38.346
Hopefully you are able to reconstruct back
the virus or the images as we represent

169
00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:44.147
here. So, imagine that you take multiple
cameras of the same thing and, but you

170
00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:50.300
occlude the cameras in a random fashion.
you add a lot of noise. So now you have

171
00:17:50.312 --> 00:17:56.374
multiple pictures of the same scene. And
now somebody comes and say hey, give me

172
00:17:56.386 --> 00:18:02.260
back the shape of that building. Very
challenging but hopefully doable because

173
00:18:02.272 --> 00:18:07.972
you have multiple copies. So, what are
some of the challenges that we have here?

174
00:18:08.092 --> 00:18:14.619
We have very low SNR. We have this problem
with alignments and missing data. And, we

175
00:18:14.631 --> 00:18:20.376
need a lot of free time to remove the
noise and basically we are going to have

176
00:18:20.388 --> 00:18:26.771
computational challenges. So lets see how
we address each one of these challenges.

177
00:18:26.894 --> 00:18:33.054
In part together and in part separate and
this is a very tough problem but I think

178
00:18:33.066 --> 00:18:39.469
your going to get happy to see the kind of
resize that we can get. So lets get into

179
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:45.768
that. The first thing that we have to do
is define a distance. Remember we want to

180
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:51.983
align this projections or this, this three
dimensinal shapes but with missing

181
00:18:52.082 --> 00:18:57.720
Information with the missing wedge, and
with noise. So, how do I design, going

182
00:18:57.732 --> 00:19:03.585
back to the images in 2D projections of
the buildings. How do I design when these

183
00:19:03.597 --> 00:19:09.420
2 are aligned, or they are not aligned? I
need to basically define a distance. And

184
00:19:09.432 --> 00:19:14.350
we take any 2 images, we look at the 2
projections, or 2, 3 dimensions,

185
00:19:14.467 --> 00:19:20.620
depending. Depending where are we working,
and how do I know if these two are aligned

186
00:19:20.632 --> 00:19:26.560
or not? That's the first thing we need to
do, basically to define a distance. We are

187
00:19:26.572 --> 00:19:32.000
going to allow the images to rotate and
also translate later on, and we want to be

188
00:19:32.012 --> 00:19:37.613
able to say, hey, keep rotating, keep
rotating, stop. That's where you are

189
00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:44.146
align, so I need to define the distance
between two images with to noise and with

190
00:19:44.158 --> 00:19:50.654
the missing . So let's illistrate that.
That's the first step every time that we

191
00:19:50.666 --> 00:19:57.165
need to align images. How to decide when
they are already aligned? ,, . So we have

192
00:19:57.177 --> 00:20:03.840
1 image here, which I represent as a 1
dimension signal. Here, we have this 1

193
00:20:03.852 --> 00:20:10.940
dimensional signal. And we represent it
here. But we don't have the whole signal.

194
00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:18.190
We actually have the missing wedge. So we
only have the signal in certain parts of

195
00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:24.905
it. Now we have another signal. And also
for it, we have a missing wedge. Very

196
00:20:24.905 --> 00:20:29.555
important.
We basically do'nt have the missing wedge

197
00:20:29.567 --> 00:20:36.006
in the same place. Remember, these
particles were rotated. So the missing

198
00:20:36.018 --> 00:20:42.071
wedge is kind of fixed for a particular
aquisition. But the particles are all

199
00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:46.142
rotated so with respect to them the
missing wedge is all the time in a

200
00:20:46.154 --> 00:20:51.030
different position. Now if you actually
know where the missing wedge is or you can

201
00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:55.720
guess. It's either you know from the
instrument or you kind of guess it because

202
00:20:55.732 --> 00:21:01.655
there is a lack of signal to noise. There.
And these are basically the two images

203
00:21:01.667 --> 00:21:07.730
that we need to basically decide a
distance between them. We wish to have

204
00:21:07.742 --> 00:21:14.855
them like here, complete, but we only have
portions of them. And the only place where

205
00:21:14.867 --> 00:21:20.077
we can compare them is when we have
Portions of both. So here, we have

206
00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:25.583
information for the first one. But there's
no information for the second one. Here,

207
00:21:25.694 --> 00:21:30.943
we had, for the second one, not for the
first one. So the only place where we can

208
00:21:30.955 --> 00:21:36.104
compare is when we have information for
both of them. So we can take a distance.

209
00:21:36.242 --> 00:21:42.166
Euclidean distance or any distance that
you think is appropriate. But we need to

210
00:21:42.178 --> 00:21:49.015
only consider places where both of them
are available and that's by this product.

211
00:21:49.135 --> 00:21:54.842
So this and this are basically square
binary signals. 1 I have a signal 0, I

212
00:21:54.854 --> 00:22:01.163
don't have a signal. And I can only look
at places where both of them are 1. So I

213
00:22:01.175 --> 00:22:08.078
have signals for both of them. again, you
can just take that basically almost any

214
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:14.962
type of metric that you wish, and
illustrate it here with just a , Type of

215
00:22:14.974 --> 00:22:21.216
distances. And this is going to be kind of
your distance. You take the difference

216
00:22:21.228 --> 00:22:27.333
between the images but you only consider
where both of them are available and of

217
00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:33.535
course you have to normalize. By the
amount of energy they have per signal, and

218
00:22:33.547 --> 00:22:37.443
that's basically written here. That's
standard.

219
00:22:37.443 --> 00:22:43.827
Always a, a dis, distance with the pen of
how much overlap you found, and we really

220
00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:49.897
do basically normalize for that. So that's
the distance that we're going to use to

221
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:55.925
illustrate the examples in the next few
slides. Now this distance, actually, is

222
00:22:55.937 --> 00:23:02.146
not too hard to compute. You can actually
compute in the Fourier domain. We haven't

223
00:23:02.158 --> 00:23:07.977
discussed this Course, too much about
Fourier. For those that have a background

224
00:23:07.989 --> 00:23:13.419
in signal processing, you know what
Fourier is. But we did talk about DCT, the

225
00:23:13.431 --> 00:23:19.279
Discrete Cosine Transform, so basically,
you take the signals, go into a different

226
00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:25.466
domain, in the Fourier domain. And in that
domain, you do this calculation. It's very

227
00:23:25.478 --> 00:23:31.052
convenient to do that for computational
reasons. It's also very convenient to do

228
00:23:31.064 --> 00:23:36.638
that there, because it's very easy to
represent a wedge than missing information

229
00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:42.376
there. So we have this distance which is a
euclidean distance, but weighted for the

230
00:23:42.388 --> 00:23:45.221
regions where we have common information.
