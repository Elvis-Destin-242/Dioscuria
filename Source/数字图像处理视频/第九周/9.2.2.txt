>> That was our first step. 
 >> Now, we get a lot of these volumes. >> So, we basically go into our 
three-dimensional data, that we got from the tomograms. 
 >> We found, so we have the three-dimension data. 
 >> We go and look for all the areas with the virus, and we segment out those 
spikes, or envelopes. >> Sometimes that's, that done by hand. 
 >> Basically, somebody goes and places a box around each one of them. 
 >> Sometimes you can do that automatically if you have a model of 
what, more or less, you expect. >> Then you travel around your image 
with that model. >> And you do, a distance at every 
place. >> And if the distance is small, you 
say, oh. >> It looks like there is 1 of these 
envelopes here. >> It's very similar to what we did, we 
did with non local means. >> In non local means, we were looking 
for similar patches. >> Now, the patch is a model that you 
have and with it, you go wrong. >> So, either one of those ways, either 
manual or with this semi-automatic, you get this volumes. 
 >> This volumes can be like a 100x100x100 pixels representing, 
basically, the envelope inside this spike that we have. 
 >> Now remember, these are noisy, they're not all the same. 
 >> We need to group them, we need to align them, and that's what we're 
going to basically do. >> We are going to align them first, 
and there still very noisy. >> So the alignment is not going to be 
great because you're trying to align things that are very, very noisy. 
 >> but it's a good step. >> You can actually, only if you want, 
align those that are. >> Basically, it put a very, very high 
threshold and very high level of confidence in the alignment. 
 >> And you say I'm going to align them. >> Only those that basically after I 
align, the distance is almost zero. >> They're almost identical. 
 >> So, then I have more confidence that I have than. 
 >> Good alignment. >> Once again alignment is you start 
and just rotate them until the distance that we show in the previous slides 
becomes the smallest possible. >> Once you have them aligned, then 
classification becomes a bit easier. >> So you say okay now I have them all 
aligned. >> I have them all in a common space. 
 >> Now I want to group them to try to only put in the same group those 
envelopes that basically have the same 3 dimensional shape. 
 >> And there are many ways of doing this classification or clustering that we 
need there. >> But let me just illustrate to you 
one example. >> So you have all of them aligned. 
 >> And now you have the distance, the distance that basically led you to the 
smallest raw, the smallest alignment rotation. 
 >> So you have, you align them, you rotate them, you align them, you have the 
distance. >> And now, you basically, how do you 
group them, you. >> Group all of them. 
 >> So you pick one, and you say, hey, bring me all my friends. 
 >> Who are my friends? Don't have very small distance to me. 
 >> That's 1 group. >> Then you pick another one. 
 >> And say, bring me all my friends. >> And who are the friends? Those that 
I go a very small distance. >> So you basically group them. 
 >> Once you group. >> If you did everything right, you can 
basically average them. >> And we know that the average would 
reduce the noise. >> That's what we taught before. 
 >> We explained when we were doing image denoising. 
 >> So you can kind of denoise them a tiny bit. 
 >> And after you denoise them a tiny bit, you can say, hey, let's try to align 
them again. >> Now, there are a bit more clean 
images. >> So we are going to align them again. 
 >> We are going to cluster again. >> We are going to align them again. 
 >> And we are going to cluster them again. 
 >> And you repeat that for a number of iterations until you're satisfied. 
 >> Either that things are not changing too much. 
 >> Or basically you say, this is the best I can do, so I'm going to stick with 
that, and that's a process. >> With the final distance, with 
alignment, clustering, alignment, clustering, and the big thing here, once 
again, and we're going to come again and again to that, if we have a lot of this 
 >> Small boxes. >> Now, I want to reiterate to you, all 
this is done in three dimensions. >> These 100x100x100 cubes, we have 
like 4,000 of them. >> Sometimes we have 10, 20,000 of 
them. >> So, a lot of computations. 
 >> We need to align everybody with everybody. 
 >> We need to compare everybody to everybody. 
 >> We need to do that many, many times. >> You can speed up these using 
different, basically, tricks. >> One is for this particular case, 
going to Fourier domain. >> Normally these things are 
implemented in GPU's and, and very, very efficient implementations to make them 
run in hours and not in weeks. >> So that's what we have that more 
challenging, the most challenging part, computationally is this alignment part 
because we have to basically try all these angles, and that's normally done in 
the, in the Fourier domain. >> For these types of examples, as we 
say, because of the missing wedge and because of the, the speed. 
 >> Now, you have an algorithm. >> You have, you've developed this 
image processing algorithm, and you're going to use it to detect the 
three-dimensional shape of the envelope in the HIV virus. 
 >> But then you say to yourself, how do I know if my algorithm works? Nobody has 
ever seen the envelope at the resolution that I want to see it. 
 >> So, how can I validate? And this is very important when you're talking about 
medical. >> Imaging. 
 >> Because you don't want to make mistake and mislead, let's say, a 
complete vaccine development because you made a computational mistake. 
 >> So, what you do in most image processing, but in particular when you're 
talking with medical imaging, is you go slow. 
 >> First, you start from what are called phantoms. 
 >> You create three dimension shapes that look like viruses from your prior 
knowledge. >> You add noise. 
 >> You project them. >> You make missing wedges. 
 >> So you make them like they were acquiring the microscope. 
 >> And you run your algorithm for that. >> You know the grand truth, because 
you created it. >> You hope. 
 >> To reconstruct. >> And to you don't finish that, you 
don't move up. >> So, you solve this. 
 >> You say, great. >> I put different structures. 
 >> Phantoms I created. >> I rotate, add noise, add missing 
wedge. >> I got them back. 
 >> I'm happy. >> The next step, because it's almost 
impossible to do a perfect simulation. >> Of everything that is going in the 
microscope, is you take particles that, for some reason, we know their structure. 
 >> Maybe because they are larger than the HIVs, maybe because they are more 
rigid. >> And they could be acquired with 
other technologies. >> And one of them is what's called the 
GroEL, the GroEL. >> So, you go into your microscope, you 
put GroEL, you run your algorithm. >> You get the 3D shape that everybody 
knows is the right shape. >> You say, okay, this is as much 
validation as I can do. >> Now, I'm ready to do HIV. 
 >> Even here, you can do a lot of validation. 
 >> For example. >> You can take these 4000 samples and 
drop 500 of them. >> Do your computations. 
 >> Then drop a different 500 at random. >> Do your computations. 
 >> And you expect to get very similar results. 
 >> So, still here you have to do a lot of validation. 
 >> But this is a regular progress: phantoms, no data, and then you go into 
the unknown. >> Which is the HIV. 
 >> Remember, we are looking for these tiny spikes here, and which are, we're 
talking about basically, arms strokes that's what basically, the size is that 
we are talking. >> Now, let me reiterate to you why 
this is so important in this schematic. >> These are what we have been seeing, 
let me show that again. >> This is basically a true example 
from this prior tomography, one slice, and now, this is a schematic of that. 
 >> Now, as I said, when it goes and tries to latch itself into the membrane, 
it actually tries to, basically, grab from something, which is called a CD4, 
here. >> And then, the virus has these two. 
 >> Components that are the gp120, basically this red, and the gp41, this 
blue. >> And it's like, you know, you could 
think maybe as a flower that is opening and then trying to latch. 
 >> Into the CD4. >> And once again, it's very important 
to understand how this confirmation is latching, how it's contacting. 
 >> How it's basically managing to grab the CD4 and are there any changes 
happening when that's. >> Going on. 
 >> Now, this has been very, very elusive. 
 >> It's very, very hard to find, but this is the importance. 
 >> Again, we have this schematic. >> This latching, this contact, is 
critical for the virus to go into the host cell. 
 >> So that's a very important step. >> Here. 
 >> And we work, if I was lucky to work on this with people at NIH, at the 
National Institute of Health. >> And I'm going to show you some 
results of these, and much more research has been done on this area. 
 >> But this is important and enough >> To illustrate the example for this 
image processing class. >> And normally, what you do, is, you 
basically have the virus in different states. 
 >> And then you try to look at this 3D shape in different states. 
 >> And for the particular examples I'm going to show to you. 
 >> We have 400 viruses. >> From them, we got 4,000 of these 
spikes and envelopes under different states. 
 >> So, what's called unliganded with a b12 complex and with other eh, eh, 
complexes. >> So, just different states. 
 >> We want to concentrate on the image processing part. 
 >> This is what you see, this is your raw data. 
 >> You put the virus, you did the cryotomography, you basically put all the 
tiles together, this is what you see, and you say, oh boy, what am I going to do 
with that? >> But, you remember that you just 
developed an algorithm that is working for other things. 
 >> So you plug your algorithm into that. 
 >> You start, you find the envelopes, you do the alignment, classification, 
alignment classification. >> And then, you start seeing progress. 
 >> You start from basically, this is kind of the very beginning. 
 >> Nothing looks okay. >> If you align things which are 
completely non, if you average things which are completely non-aligned, you 
just get balls. >> You know, it just, everything going 
in every direction. >> Then things start getting better, 
better, better, better, better, better. >> You're, things start to appear, and, 
you know, you start seeing shapes. >> You didn't see anything, and after 
iterations, you start seeing shape. >> Because you're progressively 
improving your alignment, improving your classification, and then we know that if 
we average things that are the same, the noise goes down and then we can get the 
shapes that we wanted. >> So we go from this, which kind of 
has it there, so we can see >> Them here. 
 >> And that's where you go and you either automatically manually as we say, 
you pick all these particles. >> And then you can get your 
reconstruction. >> this is actually obtained from the 
tomography. >> And what we really want, so we are 
starting to see the 3D. >> This is just one of these. 
 >> It doesn't have to be exactly this one, but it's one of them. 
 >> You see that, and you see the envelopes. 
 >> And basically, you average and classify those envelopes. 
 >> And here is what you see. >> You have the membrane that you were 
expecting. >> And, I'm going to just run this 
video. >> And this is the shape. 
 >> This is the envelope. >> That you were looking for. 
 >> And then you tried to fit pieces that, for all the reasons are known, and 
you see, oh, this is one of my validations. 
 >> Nobody has seen this in its entire composition, but they have seen pieces of 
them. >> So let's just try to bring them. 
 >> And see if we can basically fit them properly. 
 >> So this, is the envelopes that you see here. 
 >> How you go from here to here? Smart image processing. 
 >> Once you have done that, you can start doing the biology, and this is what 
the people from biology teach us, that is the important part. 
 >> Why are we doing this? We cannot explain, because now, I can look at the 
HIV envelope, under different states, and basically see that their shapes are 
different. >> Under different states, and then you 
can start making biological conclusions about that. 
 >> And say under certain confirmation this is what happen under different state 
when it's actually latching into the CD4. >> It's changing shape. 
 >> And that's extremely important for the vaccine development people. 
 >> And then the interaction starts, and then they ask you more image processing 
questions and then you try to address that. 
 >> And that's what we basically is, illustrate here with this schematic, that 
basically there is a change in shape, a change in conformation. 
 >> When there is CD4 binding. >> And that's what we illustrate here 
with this change in the arms, kind of an open. 
 >> you can see these with image processing. 
 >> You couldn't see that with your naked eye. 
 >> This is 1 of the really exciting areas, where image processing actually 
helps you see something you couldn't see. >> Before. 
 >> When we talked, for example, about activity classification, that was to do 
in the computer something that the human knows how to do. 
 >> Here is to do something that the human cannot do. 
 >> We cannot see the 3D shape just from those projections or from those 
tomography 3D reconstructions. >> We need to do this. 
 >> Image processing. >> I hope you had fun, this is an 
exciting area, and this is just the tip of the iceberg of research in image 
processing, and viruses, and microscopy. >> But it's an illustrative example 
about the power of image processing to solve. 
 >> Real progress. >> We're going to see more in the next 
video. >> Looking forward to seeing you then. 
 >> Thank you.
