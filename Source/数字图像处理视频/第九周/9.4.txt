Hello and welcome to the last video of our
image processing class. Thank you very much for spending 9 weeks
with us. I want to thank these guys, they were
helping you and helping me put this class together and you have seen them very
active. In the forums for basically all of your
questions. I want to thank you again for spending
nine weeks with us and giving us a lot of your time.
I hope you had fun, and I hope you learned a lot about image and video processing.
I'm looking forward to seeing you again, maybe even here at Duke University.
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
