00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.707
Hello and welcome back to a new week on 
image and video processing. 

2
00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:07.697
The topic of this week is medical 
imaging. 

3
00:00:07.697 --> 00:00:13.340
Medical imaging is a fascinating area. 
The challenges are incredible and so are 

4
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.646
the rewards. 
When we solve problems in medical 

5
00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:21.862
imaging, we are basically helping 
humanity and that's a great reward. 

6
00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:27.172
Now, medical imaging is very, very 
different than many other areas of image 

7
00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:30.597
processing. 
One of the differences is that very 

8
00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:36.042
often, we start the investigation, we 
started working medical imaging with a 

9
00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:41.187
problem presented to us. 
Let's see a couple of examples of that. 

10
00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:46.847
Here, we see images of skin. 
Basically, just regular pictures of the 

11
00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:51.728
skin with potential lesions, potential 
cancer lesions. 

12
00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:58.483
So, maybe a doctor knocks the door in our 
office and says, could you please help 

13
00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:00.563
me? 
What I need to do is I need to 

14
00:01:00.563 --> 00:01:04.170
automatically segment out the lesion. 
I want to measure it. 

15
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.530
I want to measure its area. 
I want to measure some of its 

16
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.248
characteristics inside and sometimes I 
even want to track it. 

17
00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:16.142
I want the patient to come again, let's 
say, after a year or after a few months 

18
00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:22.542
or after a certain period and control how 
that lesion, how that region is changing. 

19
00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:28.337
but the problem is very specific. 
So, you think, and you say, I know I have 

20
00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:33.762
learned how to do image segmentation. 
One of those techniques is active 

21
00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:37.692
contours. 
So, you can start with the contour and 

22
00:01:37.692 --> 00:01:43.147
you can let that curve deform towards the 
boundary of the object, 

23
00:01:43.147 --> 00:01:49.267
this yellow curve, and all these three 
images were actually segmented out with 

24
00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:53.817
active contours. 
You might think, oh, but this image is 

25
00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:57.672
actually extremely noisy. 
These are hertz. 

26
00:01:57.672 --> 00:02:02.392
But these hertz are, from the point of 
view of image processing, noise. 

27
00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:05.644
But you also know, know how to do image 
denoising. 

28
00:02:05.644 --> 00:02:09.904
So maybe before you apply active 
contours, you basically do image 

29
00:02:09.904 --> 00:02:13.322
denoising. 
So, this is a very important application. 

30
00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:18.547
And a particular example where we are 
applying our knowledge in image 

31
00:02:18.547 --> 00:02:23.682
processing to a particular problem. 
Let's see another example. 

32
00:02:23.682 --> 00:02:27.982
Here is another example in the area of 
cystic fibrosis. 

33
00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:34.837
And without going into too many details, 
this is a patch that is basically put on 

34
00:02:34.837 --> 00:02:42.183
the skin and it basically measures the 
amount of sweat and the concentration of 

35
00:02:42.183 --> 00:02:48.151
chloride in the sweat. 
And the basic idea, the challenge here is 

36
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:55.402
to detect this curve and detect this 
curve and compute the ratio of the areas 

37
00:02:55.402 --> 00:02:59.079
that are inside this curve and inside 
this curve. 

38
00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.445
So, once again, the scenario is that a 
doctor knocks your door and asks you, 

39
00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:09.144
explains to you the problem, and asks you 
a particular question. 

40
00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:14.942
And says, you need to detect this curve 
and you need to detect this curve for me. 

41
00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:20.239
Once we detect the curves, we can compute 
the area and that area gives us 

42
00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.888
information about the concentration of 
chloride in the sweat. 

43
00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:30.484
So, you think for a while and you say, 
this curve looks very elliptical to me. 

44
00:03:30.484 --> 00:03:36.055
Can I assume that that's an ellipse or a 
circle? You ask the doctor, this is a 

45
00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:40.442
process of communication between two 
different disciplines. 

46
00:03:40.442 --> 00:03:45.736
If the answer is yes, you say, I know how 
to detect those type of curves, they're 

47
00:03:45.736 --> 00:03:50.959
half transformed, the half transformed is 
great to detect parametric curves. 

48
00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.756
So, you apply a half transform not to the 
image but to the edges of the image and 

49
00:03:56.756 --> 00:04:01.836
you get this curve, perfect. 
Now, this is non-parametric so you can 

50
00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:07.948
either apply active contours or you can 
try obtuse threshold algorithm to see if 

51
00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:12.967
you can get this region. 
Once you get this region, you compute the 

52
00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:18.559
ratio of areas and you have solved an 
extremely important problem. 

53
00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:24.836
Now often, in medical imaging, we don't 
really attack problems like these ones 

54
00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:30.040
that I just mentioned, 
but we basically address basic research 

55
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.532
issues with data that comes from medical 
data or biological data. 

56
00:04:35.532 --> 00:04:40.983
An example of that is here. 
These are basically surfaces that 

57
00:04:40.983 --> 00:04:47.746
represent the gray matter in our brain. 
In the brain of the subject that went 

58
00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:52.490
into an MRI scanner. 
And here, we see what are called the 

59
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.032
sulci. 
So basically, our brain, our gray matter 

60
00:04:57.032 --> 00:05:01.177
is folded. 
And these are basically the bottom of the 

61
00:05:01.177 --> 00:05:04.102
folds. 
And from, for many reasons in 

62
00:05:04.102 --> 00:05:08.327
neuroscience, these curves are extremely 
important. 

63
00:05:08.327 --> 00:05:13.222
So, here is a challenge for image 
processing in 3 dimensions, 

64
00:05:13.222 --> 00:05:19.778
how to automatically compute these sulci 
curves not for a particular medical 

65
00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:26.502
problem, or medical application, but for 
a basic research, basic science, basic 

66
00:05:26.502 --> 00:05:31.706
neuroscience question. 
Once you compute these, you can create 

67
00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:38.535
very interesting networks of these sulci, 
which again, have a very important 

68
00:05:38.535 --> 00:05:44.217
neuroscience problem, 
is a very important information for many 

69
00:05:44.217 --> 00:05:49.486
neuroscience applications. 
Some of them actually related to 

70
00:05:49.486 --> 00:05:54.398
particular problems, but some of them are 
related to research. 

71
00:05:54.398 --> 00:05:57.929
So, these are just some examples of 
medical imaging. 

72
00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:00.917
We're going to see much more in the next 
videos. 

73
00:06:00.917 --> 00:06:05.855
But one of the fascinating areas of 
medical imaging is that it's a constant 

74
00:06:05.855 --> 00:06:09.929
learning experience. 
This is not done just by people that are 

75
00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:15.047
experts in image processing, 
you have to work very close with doctors, 

76
00:06:15.047 --> 00:06:19.642
with people in Biology, with 
neuroscientists, with people that 

77
00:06:19.642 --> 00:06:25.222
basically have the medical imaging 
challenges, and that basically forces you 

78
00:06:25.222 --> 00:06:31.085
to learn new problems all the time, and 
forces them to learn new techniques, and 

79
00:06:31.085 --> 00:06:35.660
basically forces both groups to work 
close with each other, 

80
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.134
which actually is a lot of fun because as 
I say, it's a constant learning 

81
00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:44.935
experiance. 
I'm going to try to teach you some of the 

82
00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:50.040
challeges in medical imaging. 
It's a huge area so I'm going to pick a 

83
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.164
few examples in the next videos to 
illustrate some of the problems, some of 

84
00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:59.870
the challenges, and some of the rewards 
when you work in medical imaging. 

85
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.831
See you in the next videos. 
Thank you very much.
