00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.711
Hello and welcome back to our image and 
video processing class. 

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:08.793
This video, we're going to be talking 
about brain imaging. 

3
00:00:08.793 --> 00:00:14.732
Brain imaging is an extremely exciting 
area with applications in basic science, 

4
00:00:14.732 --> 00:00:18.112
try to understand our brain, how we 
develop, 

5
00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:23.334
and also application in many scene as 
we're going to see in this video. 

6
00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:28.904
We are going to start with a bit of a 
discussion on a relatively new modality, 

7
00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:35.095
which is called diffusion-weighted MRI, 
diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance 

8
00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:38.267
Imaging. 
MRI is very old and it has been a 

9
00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:44.232
tremendous contribution to medicine. 
Diffusion-weighted MRI is a, as I said, a 

10
00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:49.287
relatively new technique. 
The reason I'm going to talk about it is 

11
00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:54.922
because we're going to see a very 
surprising application of one of the 

12
00:00:54.922 --> 00:01:00.981
tools that we have learned, actually in 
the segmentation week, apply now to 

13
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:05.436
diffusion imaging in a very very 
different scenario. 

14
00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:11.075
Like most of our weeks, during this 
class, we could just speak this topic of 

15
00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:17.134
medical imaging, even the topic of 
medical imaging for MRI and basically 

16
00:01:17.134 --> 00:01:22.424
talk for months about it. 
So, as before, I'm giving you a few 

17
00:01:22.424 --> 00:01:29.184
examples to provide you some motivation 
and some excitement about this area. 

18
00:01:29.184 --> 00:01:36.266
So what is diffusion-weighted imaging? 
The basic idea is relatively simple, the 

19
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:39.486
basic concept. 
So, you have a brain, 

20
00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:44.715
actually, we're talking about brain 
imaging, but you can do diffusion imaging 

21
00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:48.350
for other organs. 
You go into a magnet, an MRI machine, 

22
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.568
same type of machine, so it's kind of the 
same classical hardware. We're going to 

23
00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:58.739
just use it differently and what we're 
going to get out is measurements about 

24
00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.783
the brain connectivity. 
How is a given region in the brain 

25
00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:08.253
connected to a different region in the 
brain? Something very cool, how is this 

26
00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:12.063
connected to this? Is it connected at 
all, for example? 

27
00:02:12.063 --> 00:02:17.280
That's what we are trying to do with 
diffusion-weighted imaging and it has 

28
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.993
been used for neurological disorders, you 
know, if the connections are not what we 

29
00:02:22.993 --> 00:02:26.119
expect, that might actually mean 
something. 

30
00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:30.652
It has been used for study, as I say, 
normal brain development, 

31
00:02:30.652 --> 00:02:36.123
and in general, it's used to study the 
structure of fiber bundles, 

32
00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:41.701
basically, connections in the brain. 
What is the underlying concept in 

33
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:47.643
diffusion-weighted imaging? The 
underlying concept is the following. 

34
00:02:47.643 --> 00:02:52.228
Let me just run this. 
Let's assume, I'm going to make a drawing 

35
00:02:52.228 --> 00:02:57.907
here. Let's assume that you have a region 
in the brain that is connected to a 

36
00:02:57.907 --> 00:03:03.262
different region in the brain. 
So, grey matter, basically, and another 

37
00:03:03.262 --> 00:03:08.929
region of grey matter in the brain, 
and we assume that they're connected by 

38
00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:14.342
brain fiber bundles. 
Imagine, just cables, okay? So you have 

39
00:03:14.342 --> 00:03:20.971
two regions in the brain and you have a 
cable connecting between them. 

40
00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:29.068
Now, we have water and one efficient way 
to imaging is trying to measure the water 

41
00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:34.799
diffusion in the brain. 
Now, assume that they're trying to make 

42
00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.002
water go through the bundle in this 
direction. 

43
00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:45.776
Because the bundle is there, water will 
have a challenge to go and to move in 

44
00:03:45.776 --> 00:03:50.206
that direction. 
Now, if I try to make it go in this 

45
00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:54.260
direction, 
then, it would actually move in a much 

46
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.606
easier fashion. 
So if there is a presence of a 

47
00:03:57.606 --> 00:04:03.127
connectivity in a given direction, we can 
actually try to push the water in 

48
00:04:03.127 --> 00:04:07.884
different directions, 
and according to how successful we are in 

49
00:04:07.884 --> 00:04:11.977
pushing that water, 
we can infer the direction of these 

50
00:04:11.977 --> 00:04:17.894
bundles and then basically the 
connectivity of different regions in the 

51
00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:21.538
brain. 
So for example, if we try to diffuse the 

52
00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:26.904
water, and it goes in every direction, 
there's basically no cables. 

53
00:04:26.904 --> 00:04:32.056
If we try to diffuse the water and it 
goes in every direction, but one, 

54
00:04:32.056 --> 00:04:36.847
basically there is a cable in kind of the 
orthogonal direction, in the 

55
00:04:36.847 --> 00:04:40.735
perpendicular direction. 
So if it goes every place, but it just 

56
00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:44.943
has really difficulties going here, in 
this direction, then something is 

57
00:04:44.943 --> 00:04:48.969
stopping it in this direction. 
So it's kind of the perpendicular 

58
00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.004
direction. 
Now, you can always, you can also find 

59
00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:57.209
crossings, basically find that more than 
one direction, it's difficult to make the 

60
00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:01.362
water go through. 
And in general, you can find basically 

61
00:05:01.362 --> 00:05:06.677
the probability of diffusion in every 
direction and that gives you the 

62
00:05:06.677 --> 00:05:11.007
probability of having connections, cables 
in the brain, 

63
00:05:11.007 --> 00:05:16.407
this cable, this bundles in the brain 
between different directions. 

64
00:05:16.407 --> 00:05:21.879
How is that done? The person goes into 
the magnet, and basically, there are 

65
00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.765
gradiants created in different 
directions. 

66
00:05:24.765 --> 00:05:29.554
So it's kind of you're creating magnetic 
fields in different directions. 

67
00:05:29.554 --> 00:05:34.518
So, you go around, let's say a circle and 
you try to create that field in this 

68
00:05:34.518 --> 00:05:37.412
direction to push water in that 
direction, 

69
00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:42.491
then you try to create a field in this 
direction to push water in that 

70
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:46.160
direction. 
So you basically do that for multiple 

71
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.634
directions and you measure if you can 
move those water molecules in that 

72
00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:54.849
direction, 
then, what you get at the end is 

73
00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.661
something that looks like this. 
You, you get multiple directions, and 

74
00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:11.301
basically, people take 32 or 64, 
sometimes 128 of these directions 

75
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:21.908
depending how much time can you spend 
inside the magnet and created these 

76
00:06:21.908 --> 00:06:27.865
gradients in multiple directions. 
From that, you can infer the probability 

77
00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:32.917
of having a connection in a given 
direction, because you infer the 

78
00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:37.944
probability of moving basically the water 
in a given direction. 

79
00:06:37.944 --> 00:06:44.576
So you get all these multiple directions 
and from that, as which is said you could 

80
00:06:44.576 --> 00:06:50.993
have every single voxel in the image. 
So we are in 3D, our brain is 3D, so it's 

81
00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:56.894
got pixels without voxels. 
Basically it's kind of three-dimensional 

82
00:06:56.894 --> 00:06:58.122
pixels, 
and, 

83
00:06:58.122 --> 00:07:04.413
this is just a slice of a brain and we 
here, have here a zoom-in version of one 

84
00:07:04.413 --> 00:07:11.555
of the regions and then at every voxel, 
you get concept probability of diffusion 

85
00:07:11.555 --> 00:07:17.433
in a given direction or a probability of 
having these cables in the brain, these 

86
00:07:17.433 --> 00:07:20.563
bundles in the brain in a given 
direction. 

87
00:07:20.563 --> 00:07:25.777
And then, you can consider the whole, 
so this, I'm drawing here, the more 

88
00:07:25.777 --> 00:07:29.328
round, 
it is the more kind of isotropic uniform 

89
00:07:29.328 --> 00:07:33.022
probabilities. 
The more stretched it is, the more 

90
00:07:33.022 --> 00:07:38.777
anisotropic in that direction, and if you 
see that there is kind of a cross, then 

91
00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:42.282
there is anisotropy in more than one 
direction. 

92
00:07:42.282 --> 00:07:47.861
You can consider it completely or as we 
see here, with this red, which is, can 

93
00:07:47.861 --> 00:07:53.816
pick the maximal, what is actually very 
strong and that means that probably there 

94
00:07:53.816 --> 00:07:55.887
are fibers, 
there is cables.. 

95
00:07:55.887 --> 00:08:00.657
I keep using the word cables, 
so, because it's kind of, those that 

96
00:08:00.657 --> 00:08:06.095
connect or make basically give the 
connectivity or the conductivity between 

97
00:08:06.095 --> 00:08:09.065
regions. 
So you can only pick the maxima between 

98
00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:14.003
those and say, hey, I believe there is a 
connection in this direction and maybe, 

99
00:08:14.003 --> 00:08:17.703
also in this direction. 
We're going through this vault set, 

100
00:08:17.703 --> 00:08:23.020
so, in this vault set, we might have 
connections going in two directions, 

101
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.229
basically, strong connections going in 
two different directions. 

102
00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:34.973
Now, that's per coxel. What happen if I 
want to say, which regions are connected 

103
00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:40.562
to this region of the brain or is this 
region of the brain connected to this 

104
00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:45.018
region of the brain? 
So, that's basically, I want to go from 

105
00:08:45.018 --> 00:08:48.656
this local measurements that I get from 
the machine. 

106
00:08:48.656 --> 00:08:53.345
There is some image processing tool, 
actually get these denoising, 

107
00:08:53.345 --> 00:08:58.084
but basically, most of the work, 
basically, is done by these very smart 

108
00:08:58.084 --> 00:09:00.571
acquisition. 
So you're here, 

109
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:06.408
and you say, I want to know the 
probability of connection between now far 

110
00:09:06.408 --> 00:09:10.775
away regions. 
is this region of my brain connected to 

111
00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:14.863
this region? 
How can I measure these from these data 

112
00:09:14.863 --> 00:09:19.001
that I have just obtained? And look what 
we can do, 

113
00:09:19.001 --> 00:09:23.822
there are many things that we can do, 
but here is one of them. 

114
00:09:23.822 --> 00:09:28.646
We can do a Hough transform. 
Now, we use, we learn about the Hough 

115
00:09:28.646 --> 00:09:32.083
transform to detect straight lines or 
curves. 

116
00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:37.305
Now, we are actually going to do a Hough 
transform for something slightly 

117
00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:40.244
different, 
but these are still curves. 

118
00:09:40.244 --> 00:09:44.005
We want to find, basically, cables in 
three-dimensions. 

119
00:09:44.005 --> 00:09:49.457
So, this is how we do it. 
We basically start, let's say from a 

120
00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:56.872
point, and we say, let us find the strong 
curves going through this particular 

121
00:09:56.872 --> 00:10:01.462
point. 
So you can throw, you can just start with 

122
00:10:01.462 --> 00:10:05.107
a few samples. 
You just put many curves, 

123
00:10:05.107 --> 00:10:11.417
you can parametrize this. You can 
parametrize almost any function that you 

124
00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:16.162
desire. 
One of the ways to parametrize is just to 

125
00:10:16.162 --> 00:10:21.667
write polynomial function and say, I 
want to run, I want to just use a 

126
00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:32.053
function that is of this style. 
Let me just write an a1+a2, x+a3x^2, and 

127
00:10:32.053 --> 00:10:38.246
so on, maybe you go up to six 
exponential, seventh, 

128
00:10:38.246 --> 00:10:45.915
and then the half is going to vote for 
this coefficients. Remember, Hough 

129
00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:51.700
transform is great when we have 
parametrized curves, and here, I'm 

130
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:57.187
going to just parametrize a curve by a 
polynomial, by basically, this function 

131
00:10:57.187 --> 00:11:02.742
and x is just it coordinates in xyz in 
three-dimension, so these are kind of 

132
00:11:02.742 --> 00:11:06.595
vectors. Now, how do you do the voting? 
Very simple. 

133
00:11:06.595 --> 00:11:12.598
Remember, at every voxel, we have the 
probability of going in every direction. 

134
00:11:12.598 --> 00:11:16.526
So I take this curve and I say, is this a 
good curve? 

135
00:11:16.526 --> 00:11:22.787
I go through the voxel and I say, what's 
the probability of going at that voxel in 

136
00:11:22.787 --> 00:11:26.512
this direction? 
So basically, the tangent to the curve 

137
00:11:26.512 --> 00:11:31.362
and then you go to the next voxel, 
you know, go to the next voxel and you 

138
00:11:31.362 --> 00:11:34.937
keep going. 
So you add the probabilities that you got 

139
00:11:34.937 --> 00:11:40.012
from the data of the diffusion MRI. 
When we talk about a Hough transform, we 

140
00:11:40.012 --> 00:11:45.539
were kind of adding the edge content. 
If there is an edge, we're voting for it. 

141
00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:48.379
If there wasn't, we weren't voting for 
it. 

142
00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:53.367
Here, we actually do a weighted voting. 
We vote by the probability of going in 

143
00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:56.478
that direction, 
but it's a Hough transform. 

144
00:11:56.478 --> 00:12:01.713
This is, I think, is very beautiful, that 
we can use some very standard theory for 

145
00:12:01.713 --> 00:12:06.759
a very cool application in a modern image 
acquisation technology. 

146
00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:12.462
So, you go, and vote, and vote, and vote, 
and then you take another one, and you 

147
00:12:12.462 --> 00:12:16.766
vote, and you pick the curve that has the 
maximal vote. 

148
00:12:16.766 --> 00:12:22.933
So you say, this is the one that most of 
it or at least the majority or in a very 

149
00:12:22.933 --> 00:12:29.082
strong case, the tangents go in the 
direction that the forces tell me there's 

150
00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:35.357
a lot of probability, a high probability 
of going in that direction, a fiber or a 

151
00:12:35.357 --> 00:12:40.823
cable as we have been saying, 
then you pick another point and you do 

152
00:12:40.823 --> 00:12:45.319
the same, you pick another point and you 
do the same. 

153
00:12:45.319 --> 00:12:52.293
And in that way, you get these tracks you 
get from every point, basically, you get 

154
00:12:52.293 --> 00:12:57.174
this probability of having this cables 
and connections. 

155
00:12:57.174 --> 00:13:02.867
And then you say, is this point connected 
to a point, let's say, here? 

156
00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:07.832
If there is not a strong cable, a strong 
curve, then you say they're not 

157
00:13:07.832 --> 00:13:11.652
connected. 
You can actually make a binary system, 

158
00:13:11.652 --> 00:13:15.327
yes or no, or you can make a probability 
decision. 

159
00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:21.227
Oh, this is the probability that they are 
connected and the probability is as in 

160
00:13:21.227 --> 00:13:26.297
Hough transform, the addition of the 
local probabilities at each voxel. 

161
00:13:26.297 --> 00:13:31.492
In the same way that when we were 
detecting simple or straight lines, 

162
00:13:31.492 --> 00:13:37.257
we were saying what's basically the 
chances that this straight line had many 

163
00:13:37.257 --> 00:13:42.477
local edge detectors along it's way. 
And when you get that the end is a 

164
00:13:42.477 --> 00:13:47.018
beautiful image like this that gives you 
a lot of tracks. 

165
00:13:47.018 --> 00:13:53.235
It basically gives you a lot of 
connections between different regions in 

166
00:13:53.235 --> 00:13:57.124
the brain. 
And that, you can use for many, many 

167
00:13:57.124 --> 00:14:03.779
problems in basic neuroscience in, for 
disease, for development or for other 

168
00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:07.048
areas. 
So to recap, you're going to demand it, 

169
00:14:07.048 --> 00:14:10.469
you get these magnetic fields in 
different directions, 

170
00:14:10.469 --> 00:14:14.881
you compute the probability of having 
that cable or a fiber in a given 

171
00:14:14.881 --> 00:14:19.404
direction, and when you want to get 
information about two points, you use the 

172
00:14:19.404 --> 00:14:24.514
Hough transform to do a voting process 
and you can get that connection. 

173
00:14:24.514 --> 00:14:29.934
And this is not the only way to do that, 
it's just one way, and think is a nice 

174
00:14:29.934 --> 00:14:35.507
way to illustrate how some tools that 
work, developed for image segmentation, 

175
00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:39.340
basically, are also applicable in this 
new modality. 

176
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:44.519
Now, this has many, many uses, 
and for example, you can use diffusion 

177
00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:49.162
imaging for the very exciting area of 
deep brain stimulation. 

178
00:14:49.162 --> 00:14:54.636
And I want to discuss what this deep 
brain stimulation and some of the image 

179
00:14:54.636 --> 00:14:58.682
processing challenges there. 
So let's do that now. 

180
00:14:58.682 --> 00:15:05.137
What is deep brain stimulation? Deep 
brain stimulation, first of all, is used 

181
00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:11.637
for things like Parkinson, essential 
tremor, and at the more experimental 

182
00:15:11.637 --> 00:15:17.809
level, for clinical depression, 
and for OCD, and other neurological 

183
00:15:17.809 --> 00:15:22.767
problems. 
The basic idea is that, as we see in this 

184
00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:29.357
image, an electrode is inserted in the 
brain and pulses are sent. 

185
00:15:29.357 --> 00:15:36.826
So the electrode is inserted and there's 
also a generator that is normally put in 

186
00:15:36.826 --> 00:15:43.100
the chest with a battery and that 
generator sense electric pulses and 

187
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.273
basically stimulates a given region in 
the brain. 

188
00:15:47.273 --> 00:15:53.808
So it's brain surgery, the patient for 
most of the cases is actually awake, and 

189
00:15:53.808 --> 00:16:00.114
we are going to see the reason for that. 
So there is only local anesthesia, but 

190
00:16:00.114 --> 00:16:06.743
the person is actually awake during the 
surgery where this electrode is inserted 

191
00:16:06.743 --> 00:16:11.254
in the brain and we see kind of a 
schematic drawing here. 

192
00:16:11.254 --> 00:16:17.205
And I strongly recommend you to go for 
example in YouTube and do a search on 

193
00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:23.242
deep brain stimulation and you're 
going to see the fantastic results of 

194
00:16:23.242 --> 00:16:30.057
this surgery and some of the symptoms of, 
for example, Parkinson or essential 

195
00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:35.342
tremor basically stop immediately when 
surgery is finished. 

196
00:16:35.342 --> 00:16:40.919
It's a fascinating area. 
Now, the big challenge here is to find 

197
00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:45.470
the target, 
to find where do you want to put that 

198
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:53.684
electrode? That's the big challenge here. 
that is normally done with the help of a 

199
00:16:53.684 --> 00:16:58.101
number of components, 
two of them being a model. 

200
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:02.417
Basically, 
brain neurosurgeons know about the brain, 

201
00:17:02.417 --> 00:17:07.992
they know the literature and they have 
kind of a model of the different regions 

202
00:17:07.992 --> 00:17:12.982
in the brain and some are basically 
expressed here in a schematic way. 

203
00:17:12.982 --> 00:17:17.652
And then they use an atlas, 
they basically have an atlas of brains 

204
00:17:17.652 --> 00:17:22.782
and they say they know where those 
different regions are in the atlas. 

205
00:17:22.782 --> 00:17:29.657
And then they get some imaging for that 
particular patient, and then, they try to 

206
00:17:29.657 --> 00:17:36.707
locate those regions in the images of 
that particular patient using this atlas. 

207
00:17:36.707 --> 00:17:43.949
Now, one the challenges with the help of 
new acquisition techniques, a new image 

208
00:17:43.949 --> 00:17:50.252
processing techniques, is not to use the 
atlas anymore and to basically do 

209
00:17:50.252 --> 00:17:57.266
everything with images from that subject. 
The reason that the atlas is sometimes 

210
00:17:57.266 --> 00:18:03.911
used, as well as of course the models, is 
because the images and image processing 

211
00:18:03.911 --> 00:18:10.194
is not great and then you need to use an 
atlas to kind of help you navigate inside 

212
00:18:10.194 --> 00:18:14.039
the brain. 
Now, if we have better images and if we 

213
00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:20.146
have better image processing, we might be 
able and as going to show you in a 

214
00:18:20.146 --> 00:18:27.617
second, we are able to basically localize 
the target per subject and then do a 

215
00:18:27.617 --> 00:18:32.845
better job. 
Now, the way that people are looking into 

216
00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:39.982
advancing the brain stimulation is 
fascinating for image processing, 

217
00:18:39.982 --> 00:18:44.051
because it uses everything that you can 
get from an MR machine. 

218
00:18:44.051 --> 00:18:48.915
And of course, this is not a class on 
magnetic resonance imaging, so I'm just 

219
00:18:48.915 --> 00:18:52.962
going to name a few. 
We just saw a few minutes ago, diffusion 

220
00:18:52.962 --> 00:18:56.622
imaging and we're going to see its role 
in a second. 

221
00:18:56.622 --> 00:19:01.402
But people use different, basically, 
modalities inside the MR, 

222
00:19:01.402 --> 00:19:05.216
so the subject is in the magnetic 
resonance machine. 

223
00:19:05.216 --> 00:19:09.940
It's like, the same hardware, but you 
change the software a bit, 

224
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.272
and you can get different things like T1, 
T2, 

225
00:19:13.272 --> 00:19:19.556
susceptibility weighted imaging, and of 
course, diffusion imaging as we just saw. 

226
00:19:19.556 --> 00:19:25.621
And, to try to combine all of this, what 
do I mean by that, you basically register 

227
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:29.730
them, you align that, 
basically, we saw, we talk about 

228
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:35.642
registration when we were talking about 
HIV and image processing for viruses. 

229
00:19:35.642 --> 00:19:40.877
So you put all of them in a coordinated 
system, in the same coordinated system. 

230
00:19:40.877 --> 00:19:45.866
You might be able to bring the atlas as 
well if you wish to do so, and then, when 

231
00:19:45.866 --> 00:19:50.952
you have all that, you basically, which 
is already one of the images processing 

232
00:19:50.952 --> 00:19:54.408
challenges, 
you start doing other image processing 

233
00:19:54.408 --> 00:19:57.732
things, like for example, image 
segmentation. 

234
00:19:57.732 --> 00:20:04.521
You might be able to automatically or 
semi-automatically, for example, using 

235
00:20:04.521 --> 00:20:11.638
active contours, segment, and mark the 
regions that a neurosurgeon knows are the 

236
00:20:11.638 --> 00:20:16.786
target regions. 
So you put, your data log active contours 

237
00:20:16.786 --> 00:20:21.057
that are specialized to this type of 
challenges. 

238
00:20:21.057 --> 00:20:25.457
And the beauty of that is that, when we 
talk about active contours, normal, 

239
00:20:25.457 --> 00:20:28.607
normally, we talk about gradients of one 
image. 

240
00:20:28.607 --> 00:20:31.757
Now you can take gradients of multiple 
images, 

241
00:20:31.757 --> 00:20:34.932
because you have multiple modalities 
together. 

242
00:20:34.932 --> 00:20:39.707
So you can, we talked about T1, T2, the 
susceptibility weighted image, 

243
00:20:39.707 --> 00:20:44.269
you can actually compute gradients with 
all of them together. 

244
00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:47.913
Remember, we talked about vectorial 
gradients, 

245
00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:53.823
so now at every voxel and I have one 
scalar number, I have multiple numbers, 

246
00:20:53.823 --> 00:20:58.625
the T1, the T2, the SWI, the 
susceptibility weighted imaging, and then 

247
00:20:58.625 --> 00:21:04.623
I compute vector gradients and I do this 
vector active contours to segment the 

248
00:21:04.623 --> 00:21:09.481
regions. You can, of course, and you get 
segments like these. 

249
00:21:09.481 --> 00:21:15.995
Here are different regions of interest. 
The neurosurgeon knows more or less the 

250
00:21:15.995 --> 00:21:22.166
regions, where they are, but this gives 
are very precise segmentation of the 

251
00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:29.116
different regions of interest to help the 
neurosurgeon targeting the one that he or 

252
00:21:29.116 --> 00:21:34.992
she knows that should be targeted and 
that's where the electrode should 

253
00:21:34.992 --> 00:21:41.212
basically be touching, so you can give 
kind of a future reality of the brain. 

254
00:21:41.212 --> 00:21:47.383
It's superimposing these segments that 
you get with active contours, basically, 

255
00:21:47.383 --> 00:21:51.392
inside a three-dimensional visualization 
of the brain. 

256
00:21:51.392 --> 00:21:56.469
You can of course, add the 
diffusion-weighted imaging that we saw 

257
00:21:56.469 --> 00:22:02.413
earlier in this video and this is 
represented here with gray, these are the 

258
00:22:02.413 --> 00:22:08.989
fibers that we computed. So the 
neurosurgeon can start thinking, okay, if 

259
00:22:08.989 --> 00:22:14.836
I touch this region because it's 
connected to this, then when I put 

260
00:22:14.836 --> 00:22:21.447
basically electric pulses there, because 
I inserted my, basically, my electrode 

261
00:22:21.447 --> 00:22:27.394
there, then that would also affect this 
region because they're actually 

262
00:22:27.394 --> 00:22:30.684
connected. 
So it's not only that you're giving a 

263
00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:35.746
good target localization, you're also 
telling if you touch here, what's 

264
00:22:35.746 --> 00:22:40.732
going to be affected by you touching 
there and that's the beauty of putting 

265
00:22:40.732 --> 00:22:45.152
all these image processing all together. 
And then at the end, 

266
00:22:45.152 --> 00:22:50.615
the neurosurgeon did a lot of planning, 
and basically say, okay, this is my 

267
00:22:50.615 --> 00:22:56.385
target because you help me localize and 
you help me figure out the connections. 

268
00:22:56.385 --> 00:23:02.039
After surgery, the subject goes into a 
CT, and basically, we take a picture of, 

269
00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:07.687
this is actually the cable that is 
going to be basically going to the chest 

270
00:23:07.687 --> 00:23:12.487
for the battery and this is the electrode 
that was inserted. 

271
00:23:12.487 --> 00:23:18.572
We have segmentations of the regions and 
then the neurosurgeon can basically, 

272
00:23:18.572 --> 00:23:22.202
after surgery, see, was I in the right 
place? 

273
00:23:22.202 --> 00:23:27.795
As I say, the subject is awake and the 
subject is giving feedback to the 

274
00:23:27.795 --> 00:23:31.546
neurosurgeon. 
For example, if it's a surgery for 

275
00:23:31.546 --> 00:23:37.325
Parkinsons, then you can basically 
experiment different behaviors to see if 

276
00:23:37.325 --> 00:23:41.076
they improve with the position of the 
electrode. 

277
00:23:41.076 --> 00:23:46.808
And for example, one is the tremor, if 
the tremor stops when you localize the 

278
00:23:46.808 --> 00:23:53.357
electrode in a certain place and start 
sending certain electric pulses, then you 

279
00:23:53.357 --> 00:23:56.912
say, it looks like I'm in a good region 
there. 

280
00:23:56.912 --> 00:24:03.112
But to work even further, you can, after 
surgery visual, visualize everything that 

281
00:24:03.112 --> 00:24:08.927
happen, and here is actually real data, 
these are segmentations that were 

282
00:24:08.927 --> 00:24:16.186
obtained by type of active contours, type 
of techniques with all these modalities. 

283
00:24:16.186 --> 00:24:21.724
These are the electrodes, 
so you go and register one more modality 

284
00:24:21.724 --> 00:24:28.404
which is the CT from after surgery and 
then the neurosurgeon can say, looks like 

285
00:24:28.404 --> 00:24:34.908
I was where I wanted to be, that's great. 
I actually saw that during surgery, 

286
00:24:34.908 --> 00:24:41.259
because the subject was getting better, 
and then, electrodes actually have 

287
00:24:41.259 --> 00:24:46.067
multiple contacts, 
some have four, some new ones coming to 

288
00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:50.971
the market have 16. 
And then this post-op images can help the 

289
00:24:50.971 --> 00:24:56.199
programmer to say, which one of the 
contacts would be more effective 

290
00:24:56.199 --> 00:25:00.497
according to the position that I have 
localized there? 

291
00:25:00.497 --> 00:25:05.637
So a lot of image processing, 
we do registration from the different 

292
00:25:05.637 --> 00:25:08.205
modalities, 
we do segmentation, 

293
00:25:08.205 --> 00:25:14.023
and that helps the neurosurgeon to 
localize himself or herself inside the 

294
00:25:14.023 --> 00:25:17.769
brain of the subject to better do the 
surgery, 

295
00:25:17.769 --> 00:25:23.381
of course, doing it safer as well. 
And, in the same fashion, that is maybe 

296
00:25:23.381 --> 00:25:30.122
after surgery to do a better programming 
and understanding what was the actual 

297
00:25:30.122 --> 00:25:34.946
outcome of the surgery. 
Once again, deep brain stimulation is 

298
00:25:34.946 --> 00:25:40.491
extremely exciting and I strongly 
recommend you, if you just search, for 

299
00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:46.496
example, in YouTube, you're going to see 
actual patients that talk about how their 

300
00:25:46.496 --> 00:25:50.882
life became much better after deep brain 
stimulation. 

301
00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:56.172
From our perspect of image processing, 
tremendous challenges and, and I say, as 

302
00:25:56.172 --> 00:26:00.652
I said earlier, basic are the 
contributions to humanity are great. 

303
00:26:00.652 --> 00:26:05.588
So we're doing very very challenging 
image processing and the outcome is 

304
00:26:05.588 --> 00:26:11.267
absolutely outstanding and it's hard to 
ask for something better than that. I 

305
00:26:11.267 --> 00:26:16.827
hope you enjoyed this short video that 
shows you a few of the challenges in 

306
00:26:16.827 --> 00:26:22.777
brain imaging, which is as I say, one of 
the very active areas in medical imaging. 

307
00:26:22.777 --> 00:26:26.409
I'm looking forward to see new in the 
next video. 

308
00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:27.850
Thank you very much.
