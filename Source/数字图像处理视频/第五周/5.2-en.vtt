Hello and welcome back. 
What type of information and images can 

2
00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:10.420
we use for image and video segmentation? 
In particular, I want to discuss a bit 

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.298
about Edges and Regions. 
Let's just look at one very nice image of 

4
00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:18.846
a flower. 
we are going to assume that we want to 

5
00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:23.576
segment out this flower. 
We want to separate the flower from the 

6
00:00:23.576 --> 00:00:27.050
background. 
There are certain regions like here, 

7
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.827
where there's a very clear boundary. 
So we have this cast for example, edges 

8
00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:39.502
and gradients. 
Remember, the gradient that we represent 

9
00:00:39.502 --> 00:00:44.069
in this form. 
Which is nothing else than the vector of 

10
00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:49.990
the derivative in the image, derivative 
of the image in each direction, 

11
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.300
derivative of the image in the Y 
direction. 

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.757
we talk about how to implement that a few 
weeks ago. For example, a derivative in 

13
00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:08.683
the X direction, we could do with a 
simple filter of plus one, minus one and 

14
00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:12.333
minus one. 
Now, if we take these derivatives and we 

15
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:18.885
compute the magnitude of their vector, 
because there are very clear differences 

16
00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:22.452
in both sides of the flower in this 
region. 

17
00:01:22.452 --> 00:01:28.590
Very clearly, that will help us to 
separate the flower from the background. 

18
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.811
And we are going to see very often using 
the gradient as part of our image 

19
00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:39.290
segmentation algorithms. 
On the other hand, we see here. 

20
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.508
We might also get gradients, but we don't 
want these gradients to be part of the 

21
00:01:45.508 --> 00:01:49.628
segmentation. 
There are differences inside the flower 

22
00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:54.996
that we don't want them to appear. 
So, clearly we can use this borders, 

23
00:01:54.996 --> 00:02:00.323
these edges, or this gradient. 
We don't want to use the ones inside and 

24
00:02:00.323 --> 00:02:06.432
that makes our life a bit more difficult. 
But it also tells us that we are not 

25
00:02:06.432 --> 00:02:10.662
really looking for a uniform region 
inside the flower. 

26
00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:16.928
If we were to put that as a constraint in 
our segmentation, we will not get very 

27
00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:20.845
far, because inside the flower things 
change a lot. 

28
00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:26.362
We are actually looking for big 
differences between the flower and the 

29
00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:29.928
background. 
And therefore, edges are going to be very 

30
00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:34.950
important to segment this flower. 
As we're going to see in the future 

31
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.032
videos. 
But let us look at that slightly 

32
00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:42.670
different image. 
Look at now at this image. 

33
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.250
We clearly see a ball here, although 
they're basically, let me just get the 

34
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.729
pen, they're basically no edges here. 
We see the ball but we don't see any 

35
00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:05.514
edges, but we understand the shape, so 
here we're not going to be able to use 

36
00:03:05.514 --> 00:03:13.402
edge information, they're no edges if we 
were to compute the gradient in this 

37
00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:21.299
region here. Any pixel here we will try 
to compute the gradient, that gradient 

38
00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:28.635
will be zero or very low and won't help 
us to find a border, to find a object of 

39
00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:33.129
interest. 
On the other hand, we could use shape, we 

40
00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.178
could use regions, 
okay? 

41
00:03:35.178 --> 00:03:41.556
So we could try to understand that this 
is kind of a uniformed region, kind of a 

42
00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:45.861
uniformed region. 
And actually we can use that fact to 

43
00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:49.210
basically help us obtain the 
segmentation. 

44
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:56.454
Let's just see the edges of this image to 
further illustrate that edges won't help 

45
00:03:56.454 --> 00:04:01.080
in this case. 
So here, I took the green channel of the 

46
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.277
color image that we just saw and I 
computed, in this case I used MATLAB. 

47
00:04:07.277 --> 00:04:11.380
I computed edges. 
So we see some spurious edges. 

48
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.852
Those don't bother us too much, we 
learned in the past how to get rid of 

49
00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:20.196
them. 
For example by pre-filtering the image, 

50
00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:24.909
removing the noise before. 
We get nice edges here, but no edges 

51
00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:30.761
here, this is a tiny edge because there 
is probably a very weak boundary here, 

52
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.680
but no edges here. 
So we will need other types of 

53
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.852
information in order to be able to 
segment this ball out of the background. 

54
00:04:40.852 --> 00:04:44.720
Looks very simple, but edges are not 
sufficient. 

55
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.644
What I want to show you in the next 
videos is how to incorporate multiple 

56
00:04:49.644 --> 00:04:53.771
sources of information. 
First, we're going to start in the next 

57
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:59.228
video with half transform that's going to 
help us to integrate shape that we know. 

58
00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:04.153
If we are looking for a line we can put 
that into the segmentation or the 

59
00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:08.080
detection algorithm. 
If we are looking for circle like here, 

60
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.871
we can incorporate that into the 
algorithm and we do that with the half 

61
00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:16.199
transform. 
I'll see you in the next video for that, 

62
00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:16.865
thank you.
