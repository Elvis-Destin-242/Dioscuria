00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.131
Hello, and welcome to week five of our 
image and video processing class. 

2
00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:07.680
This is a very fun and exciting week for 
a number of reasons. 

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.521
First of all, image and video 
segmentation is a fun topic as we're 

4
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.906
going to see in the videos during this 
week. 

5
00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:17.980
Second, because during this week we're 
going to be transitioning from the 

6
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.947
fundamental material to the more advanced 
material. 

7
00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:25.609
The fundamental material is as we talk, 
that material that is used every day and 

8
00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.434
you can not take a class in image 
processing without knowing it. 

9
00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:34.097
The more advanced material is material 
that has been deviled up in the recent 

10
00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:38.706
years and is also extremely useful. 
And as we are going to see, it actually 

11
00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:44.087
often forms parts of very important 
products today in industry for image and 

12
00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:47.302
video processing. 
So let's just get into image 

13
00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:48.840
segmentation. 
As I say, 

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.421
it's going to be a lot of fun. 
But what is image segmentation? 

15
00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:56.187
We should basically first of all try to 
answer that question. 

16
00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:59.768
And we are going to answer that question 
with a few examples. 

17
00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:04.276
In image segmentation the basic idea is 
that we want to separate objects. 

18
00:01:04.276 --> 00:01:08.660
We want to call different objects by 
different names, depending on some 

19
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.550
properties of those objects. 
So for example, here we have a cat and we 

20
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.144
want to make sure that we find the 
boundary of this cat and we can separate 

21
00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:25.228
the cat here from it's background. 
So here, we have to cut and here we have 

22
00:01:25.228 --> 00:01:29.602
the background. 
So we manage to separate objects in the 

23
00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:33.822
image. 
Sometimes the user is going to help us to 

24
00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:38.214
do that. 
For example, the user can mark this is my 

25
00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:41.600
foreground. 
This is what I care, the objects I care. 

26
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.851
This is the background. 
The objects I don't care. 

27
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:50.583
Just two very simple marks and from that, 
we basically need to develop a technique 

28
00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:54.771
that will basically extract the horses 
from the background. 

29
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:59.882
And sometimes, this type of segmentation 
is called foreground background 

30
00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:03.147
separation. 
Once we do that, we can, for example 

31
00:02:03.147 --> 00:02:07.476
change the background. 
Something that is done very, very often 

32
00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:11.877
in the movie industry. 
Changing background of different scenes, 

33
00:02:11.877 --> 00:02:17.059
as we are going to see in a second. 
So this is kind of foreground background 

34
00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.590
separation. 
Sometimes, what we actually need is to 

35
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.064
label every thing that have been seen the 
image. 

36
00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:29.638
So to find regions in these image, which 
is an image of neurons taking with a 

37
00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:35.573
technique called electro microscopy that 
we are going to discuss later in this, in 

38
00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:40.193
the last week of this class. 
We have a, as I say, images of neurons 

39
00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:45.450
from electron microscopy and the idea is 
that we want to label every pixel, 

40
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.972
according to the class that, that pixel 
belongs to. 

41
00:02:48.972 --> 00:02:54.679
So basically we are coloring the image. 
We are saying all this region should have 

42
00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.779
the same label. 
It belongs to the same class, 

43
00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:01.161
the same type of object, 
the same type of tissue. 

44
00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:05.107
So we are not subtracting photograph fr, 
from background. 

45
00:03:05.107 --> 00:03:10.673
We're basically labeling every single 
region of the image and we get all these 

46
00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:16.010
segments, and then we can do analysis. 
Finally, we also have the same problems 

47
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.980
in video and we see that here. 
And this is a video that we have already 

48
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.200
saw at the very beginning of the class, 
they just basically run it. 

49
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.745
We have the video and we have a similar 
video, but with a different background. 

50
00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:41.052
For doing that, we had to extract the 
main object here from the video. 

51
00:03:41.052 --> 00:03:45.237
So, we are able to produce a different 
background for that. 

52
00:03:45.237 --> 00:03:50.505
And basically, this is what's behind a 
very important component of one of 

53
00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:55.267
Adobe's products, called After Effects. 
And we are going to learn that. 

54
00:03:55.267 --> 00:04:00.895
We are going to learn exactly what's the 
underlying technology for basically the 

55
00:04:00.895 --> 00:04:03.710
video segmentation in After Effects. 
So, 

56
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.837
there are just some examples. 
Now, what we have to do is learn how we 

57
00:04:07.837 --> 00:04:12.328
solve all of these very interesting image 
and video segmentation problems. 

58
00:04:12.328 --> 00:04:15.909
And we're going to do that exactly, 
starting in the next video. 

59
00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.305
See you then, 
thank you.
