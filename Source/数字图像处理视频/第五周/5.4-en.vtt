Hello, and welcome back. 
We just discussed the half transform as 

2
00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:08.410
one of the ways to integrate local 
computation of edges. 

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.286
I want to illustrate a second one. 
And for that, I want to use what we have 

4
00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:16.749
seen past, 
the image processing online facilities. 

5
00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:21.343
The basic idea is here. 
We are once again in the image processing 

6
00:00:21.343 --> 00:00:25.018
online website, 
and we're going to be discussing a line 

7
00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:28.573
segment detector that was described by 
the authors. 

8
00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:33.764
And, once again, it's an old technique to 
produce coherent segments, coherent 

9
00:00:33.764 --> 00:00:37.778
curves in the image, 
instead of just relying on local edge 

10
00:00:37.778 --> 00:00:42.346
detectors like the gradient. 
Let's, first of all, illustrate this by 

11
00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:46.568
showing one of the videos that they 
provide in their website. 

12
00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:51.343
And, it's going to be very clear already 
from the video what's happening. 

13
00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:55.701
So, let's just open this video, 
and see how nice it is. 

14
00:00:55.701 --> 00:01:00.926
So, you're now seeing edges. 
You're basically seeing edges all around 

15
00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.776
the image. 
That's really, really nice. 

16
00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:09.714
You're seeing the video and there're 
very, very coherent curves here in the 

17
00:01:09.714 --> 00:01:13.515
video. 
We don't see gradiants jumping from frame 

18
00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:17.236
to frame, 
and we can actually understand what's 

19
00:01:17.236 --> 00:01:21.116
happening. 
There is a person here, handing letters. 

20
00:01:21.116 --> 00:01:25.470
We can actually read the letters. 
Look how nice this is. 

21
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.115
A very clear picture of what's happening 
in the scene, because we have these 

22
00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:35.406
coherent curves going around. 
So, this is really, really nice. 

23
00:01:35.406 --> 00:01:40.606
And what we are going to do now is give a 
couple of additional examples, 

24
00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:45.878
really as we have done in the past. 
Let's just run this demo on real time. 

25
00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:50.790
So, we'll click on demo. 
And we're going to pick an image. We see 

26
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.270
here is an image of some chairs. 
And, I'm going to just, ask the algorithm 

27
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.239
to run it, and here is the result. 
So, I'm going to shift, scroll this down, 

28
00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:06.785
and then we see the output and the input. 
And once again, the output is a very 

29
00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:12.762
clear illustration of what's happening in 
this scene, and we can basically see very 

30
00:02:12.762 --> 00:02:16.579
clear curves that describe the objects in 
this scene. 

31
00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.981
Let's see one more example, I think this 
is really fun. So, let's just illustrate 

32
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:25.150
with one additional example, what's going 
on. 

33
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.640
Let's pick this image, 
and run it. 

34
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.211
And, once again, let me scroll down. 
And then, we can see the output and the 

35
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:40.868
input. 
The output, and the input. 

36
00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:47.416
And from the output, basically from the 
coherent lines, that this algorithm has 

37
00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:53.208
found, basically we can see the 
buildings, we can understand the basic 

38
00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:58.077
objects in the scene. 
And that's because there's kind of an 

39
00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:02.610
integrations of what are important curves 
in the scene. 

40
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.442
And what we're going to see in some of 
the future videos is other techniques 

41
00:03:07.442 --> 00:03:12.738
based on what's called active controls 
that also provide basically integrations 

42
00:03:12.738 --> 00:03:16.842
of the local behavior to give us coherent 
curves in the image. 

43
00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:19.888
Thank you very much. 
See you in the next video.
