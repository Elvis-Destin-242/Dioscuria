Hello and welcome back. 
Active contours, also called snakes, are 

2
00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:07.017
very important in image and video 
processing. 

3
00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:12.001
They appear in a number of commercial 
products and they are very useful for 

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:16.591
numerous image and video segmentation. 
Let me illustrate the basic concept 

5
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:21.407
behind active contours. 
The idea is that you start from one or 

6
00:00:21.407 --> 00:00:25.733
multiple curves. 
For example, I'm going to draw a curve 

7
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:30.568
that surrounds the flower, which is my 
object of interest. 

8
00:00:30.568 --> 00:00:37.438
And the basic idea behind active contours 
is to design velocities that will move 

9
00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:42.867
this curve towards the flower. 
Hopefully, as the curve moves, it's going 

10
00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:49.238
to end up in the border of the flower. 
So, we need basically to design 

11
00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:55.610
velocities that will move any initial 
contour towards the contour of interest, 

12
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.278
which is the boundary of the object of 
interest. 

13
00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:05.162
Now, I can write down, the formulation 
for this and the equations for this, but 

14
00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:11.351
I think it's better if we first learn the 
material that is coming next week, as a 

15
00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:17.142
back ground, and that will help us to 
write this in a much, much elegan, form. 

16
00:01:17.142 --> 00:01:21.247
So, this week, 
instead of writing down the exact weight 

17
00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:25.352
of active counters, 
I'm going to just illustrate you some 

18
00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:31.662
examples to motivate you and get you very 
excited to learn the background, material 

19
00:01:31.662 --> 00:01:37.135
that we're going to learn next week. 
So, let's go and watch some movies with 

20
00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:41.924
examples of active contour, 
inside the image processing online 

21
00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:47.550
package and inside Adobe's Photoshop. 
So, let's just observe that right now. 

22
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.268
In order to illustrate one of the 
examples of active contours, we're going 

23
00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:57.750
to be using, again, the image processing 
online website where, as we have seen 

24
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.163
before, there is many very interesting 
image processing algorithms implemented. 

25
00:02:03.163 --> 00:02:06.979
And particularly, now, we are in the 
Chan-Vese webpage, 

26
00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.351
which is an implementation of one of the 
approaches for active contours developed 

27
00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:17.879
by Tony Chan and Luminita Vese. 
Before we show you one of the examples 

28
00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.868
running actually in real time, let's just 
basically run the demo provided by the 

29
00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:28.244
author of this website. 
So here, we see contours evolving. 

30
00:02:28.244 --> 00:02:33.774
This is a very clear example of a contour 
evolving towards the segment. 

31
00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:37.240
Here, we have another one, just look at 
this one. 

32
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.320
And here, we see once again, how contours 
are evolving and yet once again. 

33
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.833
So, that's a basic idea of active 
contour. This was a very fast video, just 

34
00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:53.287
to illustrate one of the examples. 
But let's just run one, so we're going to 

35
00:02:53.287 --> 00:02:57.742
have more time, to look at it. Wwe're 
going to run the demo online as we have 

36
00:02:57.742 --> 00:03:02.136
done in the past for other algorithms. 
I'm going to pick this, example, it's 

37
00:03:02.136 --> 00:03:06.769
just one example, I'm not going to change 
the parameters, we don't know exactly 

38
00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.520
since we haven't discussed the technique, 
what this parameter means, so I'm going 

39
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.490
to just, leave the default and I'm going 
to run it. 

40
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.997
Remember, now is rhyming as we see here, 
but it's rhyming in the server wrap that 

41
00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:23.134
is provided by the imaging processing 
online. 

42
00:03:23.134 --> 00:03:28.362
The algorithm is actually much, much 
faster, than we can see, it actually can 

43
00:03:28.362 --> 00:03:31.638
be run on real time, but it's run on the 
server. 

44
00:03:31.638 --> 00:03:35.990
And here is the result. 
We see once again, the initial contours, 

45
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.576
these intial contours at the very 
beginning are the initial contours and 

46
00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:45.069
then, we see the boundaries. 
The curves have evolved toward those 

47
00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.785
boundaries. 
The curves have evolved to segment out 

48
00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:53.392
the object of interest. 
There are some spurious objects and we 

49
00:03:53.392 --> 00:03:58.743
are going to understand why they happen, 
but mostly, it has done a great job 

50
00:03:58.743 --> 00:04:04.688
basically, in finding the boundary of the 
flower, which is probably the object of 

51
00:04:04.688 --> 00:04:09.221
interest for this image. 
And we see once again, these contours 

52
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:12.465
evolving. 
And this is, as I say, something that 

53
00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:17.401
we're going to learn next week. 
Exactly the formulas, exactly the math 

54
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:20.263
behind it. 
But this illustrates the idea. 

55
00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:26.085
Thank you for this part of the video. 
It's now time to illustrate using Adobe 

56
00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:29.896
Photoshop one implementation of active 
contours. 

57
00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:35.771
In particular, we're going to be using 
this tool in active contours that is a 

58
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:39.264
selection tool and look what's going to 
happen. 

59
00:04:39.264 --> 00:04:44.360
Please observe my mouse. 
Look how I'm moving the mouse and the 

60
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.490
contours are being automatically 
attracted to the boundary of the flower. 

61
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.832
You know, how I just clicked and it's 
basically catching the flower. 

62
00:04:54.832 --> 00:05:00.598
I almost didn't move my mouse, I just 
click inside the object of interest, and 

63
00:05:00.598 --> 00:05:04.941
we capture the flower. 
Let me do that again here. I'm going to 

64
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:08.984
just click and it's capturing this part 
of the flower. 

65
00:05:08.984 --> 00:05:15.049
So, you see how we can help, and we have 
already learned about user interaction by 

66
00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:21.040
doing a few clicks inside the flower. 
Basically, a technique related to active 

67
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.918
contours, move my clicks towards the 
boundaries of the object of interest. 

68
00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:30.300
This is a very, very interesting 
technique, 

69
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.943
this time, implemented inside Adobe 
Photoshop. 

70
00:05:33.943 --> 00:05:39.450
And this provides in our demo of active 
contour type of approaches. 

71
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.489
Thank you. 
These examples that we just saw should 

72
00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:47.141
motivate you for the material that is 
coming next week. 

73
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:52.254
Before we go into that, we have a couple 
of additional and very, very exciting 

74
00:05:52.254 --> 00:05:57.035
things to learn about video segmentation. 
So, I see you in the next video. 

75
00:05:57.035 --> 00:05:57.700
Thank you.
