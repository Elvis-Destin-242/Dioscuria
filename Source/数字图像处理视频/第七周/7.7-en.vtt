00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Hello and welcome back. 
Let us now talk about Video Inpainting. 

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.734
You basically already have all the tools 
to do Video Inpainting. 

3
00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:17.601
Remember, and I'm showing these in very 
slow motion, a video is a sequence of 

4
00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:22.773
frames, a sequence of images. 
So, we can basically use the tools that 

5
00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:27.560
we developed for Image Inpainting now in 
Video Inpainting. 

6
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.047
How? 
For example, we can take, in the Cut and 

7
00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:37.456
Paste, instead of two-dimensional patches 
x, y, we can consider three-dimensional 

8
00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:40.781
patches x, y, t and look at them in the 
video. 

9
00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:46.865
In the whole video, that would be very 
expensive but we can look at them in 

10
00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:51.504
segments of the video. 
We can also run the partial differential 

11
00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:56.100
equations or the variational formulations 
considering, for example, 

12
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.845
three-dimensional gradients. 
When we talk about curvature, we can 

13
00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:06.747
consider the videos as surfaces and talk 
about surface curvatures like Mean 

14
00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:12.260
curvature or Gaussian curvature. 
So basically, the same type of concepts, 

15
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.230
Laplacian, we can take derivatives in the 
x, y, and t directions. 

16
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.051
Some type of concepts, we can expand to 
do Video Inpainting. 

17
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:28.561
And that's how today, Video Inpainting is 
done in the literature extending those 

18
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:33.946
concepts that we saw for images. 
Now, Video Inpainting has a bit of 

19
00:01:33.946 --> 00:01:37.000
different characteristics. 
For example, 

20
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.450
here, let me just show you with the 
arrows. 

21
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.034
There are some objects that are static in 
the video so they will never appear in 

22
00:01:49.034 --> 00:01:53.616
any of the frames. 
And there are some objects that move in 

23
00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:59.265
the video so it's slightly different if 
we want to remove static objects than if 

24
00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:03.900
we want to remove moving objects. 
For example, if we want to remove a 

25
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.766
moving object, all what we have to do is 
wait until it's gone in one of the future 

26
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:13.894
frames and copy from those frames into 
the current frame. 

27
00:02:13.894 --> 00:02:18.710
So, I want to remove this now. 
Look at my pointer, now it's gone. 

28
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.566
So, I basically can copy those pixels, 
those pixels from future frames into the 

29
00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:31.267
current frame. Because the object is 
moving, the current background appears in 

30
00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:34.501
some of the previous or some of the 
future frames. 

31
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:37.670
When the object is fixed, it's slightly 
different. 

32
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.844
The background is never revealed but this 
Cut and Paste or partial differential 

33
00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:46.401
equations or variation of formulations 
will work there. 

34
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:50.670
So, you could if you want make a 
distinction between these two and 

35
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.780
differently inpaint each region or you 
could just let those techniques that we 

36
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.820
described for images work with all the 
objects. 

37
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.229
Here, we see an example of this video 
inpainted with those combination of Cut 

38
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:11.012
and Paste propagation of information as 
we have seen, we basically have removed a 

39
00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:16.744
number of objects, we have removed 
basically this, this, and this. We have 

40
00:03:16.744 --> 00:03:23.284
removed both static and dynamic objects 
with those techniques without making any 

41
00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:28.098
explicit distinction between them. 
Here is another example. 

42
00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:32.924
what we want to remove now, as you see, 
is this object. 

43
00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:36.630
Remember, for inpainting you get the 
video, 

44
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.627
as we got the image, you have to get the 
mask, a video with the mask. 

45
00:03:41.627 --> 00:03:47.296
Now, of course, doing that by hand for 
video is much more time-consuming than 

46
00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:52.890
doing it by hand for still images. 
But we have to mix to do segmentation in 

47
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.410
video as we have seen, for example, the 
Roto Brush in Adobe's After Effects. 

48
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.095
And here is the, the result of basically 
removing this person or this mask. 

49
00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:07.907
And you see the video looks completely 
natural. 

50
00:04:07.907 --> 00:04:14.315
We, it's very hard to realize for us that 
this is not the original video but it 

51
00:04:14.315 --> 00:04:20.156
actually is not and it's actually 
inpainted with this dynamic object. 

52
00:04:20.156 --> 00:04:26.483
And now here, we have a second example. 
This is an example that we have already 

53
00:04:26.483 --> 00:04:32.972
seen in the past and once again, we are 
basically removing one object and making 

54
00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:36.460
you believe that it was the original 
video. 

55
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.437
This basically concludes our presentation 
of Image and Video Inpainting. 

56
00:04:43.437 --> 00:04:49.019
We have seen very, very good techniques 
for doing this and as we talked in the 

57
00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:52.890
past, this is used a lot, for example, 
in the movie industry. 

58
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.097
But its also used a lot to improve our 
own pictures, our own images, and remove 

59
00:04:58.097 --> 00:05:00.968
objects that we don't like on those 
images. 

60
00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:04.105
I hope you had fun, this is really a fun 
topic. 

61
00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:08.444
You can make a lot of nice stuff with 
Image and Video Inpainting. 

62
00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:12.383
Thank you very much and I am going to see 
you again next week. 

63
00:05:12.383 --> 00:05:13.051
Thank you.
