00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.974
Hello and welcome back. 
Let us now describe the first image 

2
00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:07.882
Inpainting model. 
That's going to base, be based on partial 

3
00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:11.453
differential equations that we learned 
the last week. 

4
00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:16.236
But again, this is going to be self 
contained, we're going to understand 

5
00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:21.020
exactly what kind of partial differential 
equation are we going to use? 

6
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.649
When we talk about image in painting we 
talk about the following. 

7
00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.940
We have an image. 
Here and we have a region. 

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.989
Where we want to change the content of 
the image. 

9
00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.717
In this case it's the cable. 
Here. 

10
00:00:36.717 --> 00:00:41.180
Someone's going to provide us this. 
Image and painting. 

11
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.760
Includes the topic where we basically 
have these two inputs into the system. 

12
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.753
We are not going to detect, this is a 
very subjective, very often a very 

13
00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:56.159
subjective topic about what is that we 
want to change. 

14
00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.614
Maybe somebody wants to change the shoes. 
In this case, we want to change this. 

15
00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:05.712
Now, how we detect these. 
We talk a lot about segmentation. 

16
00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:10.530
So we can segment out objects. 
And those are the regions of missing 

17
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.053
information. 
We are going to call them origins to be 

18
00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:17.360
inpainted. 
With these two images, we want to make, 

19
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.452
basically, in this case, the cable 
disappear. 

20
00:01:20.452 --> 00:01:23.420
We want to inpaint in. 
These regions. 

21
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.806
And the first topic we're going to 
discuss is how do we inpaint with rich, 

22
00:01:28.806 --> 00:01:32.397
with information from the surrounding 
regions. 

23
00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:36.456
We're not going to take information from 
very far away. 

24
00:01:36.456 --> 00:01:41.374
We are only going to use information from 
the surrounding regions. 

25
00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:46.213
So we get two images. 
The original image and an image which is 

26
00:01:46.213 --> 00:01:51.600
a binary mask of the, representing the 
regions that we want to in paint. 

27
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.323
When I personally started working on 
Image Inpainting with my group, we 

28
00:01:57.323 --> 00:02:03.691
visited a professional restaurenteur, a 
professional curator at the Minneapolis 

29
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:08.044
Institute of arts. 
And we asked this person how do you 

30
00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:13.283
inpaint, how do you restore? 
And its very interesting because they 

31
00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:18.926
were doing it the way that children draw. 
And here is the illustration. 

32
00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:23.360
We have a region to be inpainted and we 
have the image. 

33
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.943
So, they first continue the boundaries of 
the regions. 

34
00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:34.170
So, if there is a boundary here going 
inside the region to being painted. 

35
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.803
So then they continue the boundary 
inside. 

36
00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:44.290
The same way that a child would basically 
draw the outlines of the objects. 

37
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.207
Then, they complete the color. 
So first, they continue the boundaries. 

38
00:02:49.207 --> 00:02:52.803
Then, they propagate the colors inside 
the region. 

39
00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:58.528
And then, lastly, they normally add kind 
of noise because paintings, and in this 

40
00:02:58.528 --> 00:03:04.473
case it was a professional restorator of 
paintings don't look flawed so you have 

41
00:03:04.473 --> 00:03:08.950
to kind of add this granularity to make 
it look more natural. 

42
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.360
And we are going to talk about these. 
First we will talk about these two steps. 

43
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.615
Then we are going to discuss a bit about 
this step which there are many techniques 

44
00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:22.414
to do that. 
That's what. 

45
00:03:22.414 --> 00:03:27.809
So remember, there's kind of a 
continuation of the geometry, basically 

46
00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:31.406
the boundary and then filling with the 
colors. 

47
00:03:31.406 --> 00:03:36.723
It's like if this is water, we are 
going to let the water flow into the 

48
00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:42.666
region, but because we have the boundary, 
it's going to actually, the right water 

49
00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:48.593
is going to flow into the right regions. 
Now, the job is to design a partial 

50
00:03:48.593 --> 00:03:52.840
differential equation that emulates this 
process. 

51
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.301
And here it is. 
So we have basically the image outside 

52
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:02.762
and we have a region of missing 
information inside. 

53
00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:07.572
And we want to propagate the information 
from outside in. 

54
00:04:07.572 --> 00:04:11.946
The way we're going to do that is with 
this equation. 

55
00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:18.418
This is the first component of imaging 
painting with partial differential 

56
00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:21.480
equations. 
So what's happening here? 

57
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.303
Is the information that we want to 
propagate. 

58
00:04:25.303 --> 00:04:31.420
I am not telling you yet what is that 
information.So is the information. 

59
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.274
That we want to propagate. 
And n is the direction that we're 

60
00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:43.908
propagating that information. 
So n is the direction that we're doing 

61
00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:48.104
the propagation. 
Now look what happens here. 

62
00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:52.300
We have gradient l meaning the change of 
L. 

63
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.155
Inner product with N = 0. 
This is a change of A and it's projected, 

64
00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:06.667
because of the inner product, into N, the 
direction of propagation and we want it 

65
00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:11.362
to be equal to zero. 
So this is of course a vector. 

66
00:05:11.362 --> 00:05:16.340
It's the gradient of information. 
So we have a vector. 

67
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.870
And we want that vector to be 
perpendicular to the direction that we 

68
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.961
are propagate, and we're have, so this is 
going to be the gradient of L, and this 

69
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:32.370
is going to be the direction. 
We want them to be basically 

70
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.580
perpendicular in the sense that we 
want to propagate information L. 

71
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.792
In such a way that is it does not change, 
it does not change in the direction of 

72
00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:49.150
the propagation.That's exactly what it 
means propagating information. 

73
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.888
I move it in the direction that is 
constant along that direction. 

74
00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:59.303
That's what this equation is basically 
telling us. 

75
00:05:59.303 --> 00:06:06.013
That L, the information is constant in 
the direction of propagation, constant 

76
00:06:06.013 --> 00:06:11.399
along these directions. 
Now how do we solve this with partial 

77
00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:15.813
differential equations? 
Assume that the image is I. 

78
00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:21.992
[SOUND] Now, we have this and we want to 
deform the image, we want to change the 

79
00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:27.814
image, this is a partial differential 
equation, in such a way that at the end, 

80
00:06:27.814 --> 00:06:32.793
we get this equal to zero. 
We have seen how to do that when we're 

81
00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:38.691
talking about Euler-Lagrange equations. 
When we want something to be equal to 

82
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:43.211
zero, how do I deform the image in order 
to accomplish that? 

83
00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:47.731
Let's think for a second how to do that. 
Remember last week. 

84
00:06:47.731 --> 00:06:51.700
How do we do that? 
Very simple. 

85
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:58.252
We basically do this. 
Let me just go back one sec. 

86
00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:05.573
We basically do this. 
We make the image change in time 

87
00:07:05.573 --> 00:07:12.455
according to what we want. 
Now, when this doesn't change anymore, 

88
00:07:12.455 --> 00:07:17.129
meaning that steady state, we get this 
equal to zero. 

89
00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:21.893
That's the definition of steady state: no 
more change. 

90
00:07:21.893 --> 00:07:27.555
Actually, the computer, when this very 
little change, we can stop. 

91
00:07:27.555 --> 00:07:31.870
When this is ideally zero, we got what we 
wanted. 

92
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.011
L. 
Constant in the direction of propagation. 

93
00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:43.549
So, this is actually a very simple trick. 
Every time you want to do something like 

94
00:07:43.549 --> 00:07:52.500
A = zero, whatever is A, some information 
of the image, you do dI dT = A. 

95
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:59.442
And you run that to a steady state. 
That's basically what we did for the all 

96
00:07:59.442 --> 00:08:03.407
day Lagrange. 
So this is the basic equation for this 

97
00:08:03.407 --> 00:08:06.897
type of imaging painting. 
Now, we haven't finished. 

98
00:08:06.897 --> 00:08:12.594
I have to tell you what's L and what's M. 
What's the information that we want to 

99
00:08:12.594 --> 00:08:15.941
propagate? 
And in which direction do we want to 

100
00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:18.790
propagate? 
And there's a lot of art here. 

101
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.205
So I'm just giving you examples. 
I'm teaching you the concepts. 

102
00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:27.051
And these are examples that are already 
very powerful. 

103
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:35.840
But you can come with different examples. 
Now, let me start by the information. 

104
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.557
We want this propagation to be smooth. 
We don't want to see a big jump inside 

105
00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:46.665
the region that we are inpainting. 
If we see a big jump, we're going to 

106
00:08:46.665 --> 00:08:49.638
notice that. 
So we want it to be smooth. 

107
00:08:49.638 --> 00:08:55.584
So it has to be anything that represent 
basically smoothness in the image, and 

108
00:08:55.584 --> 00:09:01.225
one of the things that represent 
smoothness is the Laplacian of the image, 

109
00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:05.495
the second derivative of the image 
represent smoothness. 

110
00:09:05.495 --> 00:09:07.921
Now. 
Why not the first derivative? 

111
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:11.287
Wait a second, and you're going to 
understand why. 

112
00:09:11.287 --> 00:09:16.482
Because the first derivative is also a 
representation of this bothness. 

113
00:09:16.482 --> 00:09:19.848
Now, in which direction are we going to 
propagate? 

114
00:09:19.848 --> 00:09:24.823
And now we go back to what we learned 
from professional restorators. 

115
00:09:24.823 --> 00:09:30.005
They say, continue edges. 
Now, we know that if we have an edge, the 

116
00:09:30.005 --> 00:09:34.373
gradient of the image is perpendicular to 
the edge. 

117
00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:40.711
We learned that, that week, last week, so 
we are going to want to propagate along 

118
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:47.306
the edges, which means that we have to 
take the perpendicular to the gradient, 

119
00:09:47.306 --> 00:09:53.129
so n is the perpendicular to the 
gradient, as written here, or we can 

120
00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:59.101
write that n is basically the gradient. 
But the perpendicular to it. 

121
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:04.929
So that's important thing here, that we 
want to continue edges. 

122
00:10:04.929 --> 00:10:10.756
And then, for that, we have to go 
perpendicular to the gradient. 

123
00:10:10.756 --> 00:10:18.088
And that basically also explains why we 
cannot take the first derivative of L. 

124
00:10:18.088 --> 00:10:23.821
Because if we were to put L. 
Equal to the first derivative, let's say 

125
00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:27.234
the gradient. 
These two guys are always zero. 

126
00:10:27.234 --> 00:10:31.654
So I'm not solving anything. 
Because the gradient and its 

127
00:10:31.654 --> 00:10:36.850
perpendicular are always zero. 
And I wanted basically to go kind of. 

128
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.525
Constant in that direction. 
This is not enough. 

129
00:10:40.525 --> 00:10:46.598
There is also another reason why, okay 
this is always perpendicular, it's not 

130
00:10:46.598 --> 00:10:50.194
very good. 
Although remember we're taking the 

131
00:10:50.194 --> 00:10:54.510
gradient of L. 
But the other reason is because we want. 

132
00:10:54.510 --> 00:11:00.100
Two things to be smooth inside. 
We want to continue the grey values 

133
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.119
inside to be smooth. 
We also want to con, continue the 

134
00:11:04.119 --> 00:11:09.607
boundaries to be smooth inside, so we 
need higher order of the realities. 

135
00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:15.393
Not only because these two guys are 
perpendicular and then there's not enough 

136
00:11:15.393 --> 00:11:21.475
information, even if we take the gradient 
of L, which is what actually N pending is 

137
00:11:21.475 --> 00:11:25.109
propagating. 
We want to go a bit higher order so we 

138
00:11:25.109 --> 00:11:29.782
get even more smoothness. 
And as I said, the Laplacian is one of 

139
00:11:29.782 --> 00:11:34.010
the simplest measures of smoothness. 
So, we get smoothness. 

140
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:39.540
In the opposite direction or 
perpendicular to the gradient or on the 

141
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.670
level line's direction. 
And that basically gives us our equation. 

142
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:54.850
So, we have the change of l. 
And this is the normal, is the 

143
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.868
perpendicular to the gradient. 
What we're going to get at the end of 

144
00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:05.756
this, when we get to steady state, when 
this becomes zero we basically get that 

145
00:12:05.756 --> 00:12:09.379
the Laplacian became constant along the 
edges. 

146
00:12:09.379 --> 00:12:13.531
And we have propagated the Laplacian 
along the edges. 

147
00:12:13.531 --> 00:12:19.796
That's what basically this basic equation 
makes and once again you just discretize 

148
00:12:19.796 --> 00:12:24.552
it in the computer and you run it and you 
get Image Inpainting. 

149
00:12:24.552 --> 00:12:29.874
You get propagation from outside in. 
Every differential equation has to have 

150
00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:33.651
boundary conditions. 
So, if this is my image and this is my 

151
00:12:33.651 --> 00:12:36.712
region to be in painting, what do I 
assume here? 

152
00:12:36.712 --> 00:12:41.661
And these boundary conditions for this 
type of equations, a bit of a strange 

153
00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:46.480
equation, it has three derivatives, two 
because of the Laplacian, one more 

154
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.630
because of the gradient. 
Remember. 

155
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.712
We talked about this in the past. 
But the Laplacian is the second 

156
00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:56.311
derivative of the image. 
In one direction plus the second 

157
00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:59.291
derivative of the image in the other 
direction. 

158
00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:04.165
And then we take the gradient of this. 
And we get a third derivative of 

159
00:13:04.165 --> 00:13:09.993
considering both gray values and edges in 
the boundary and those are smoothly 

160
00:13:09.993 --> 00:13:15.597
propagating inside thanks to have 
basically the Laplacian here and these 

161
00:13:15.597 --> 00:13:22.247
are as we talked the level lines of the 
image the isopoles the regions of edges, 

162
00:13:22.247 --> 00:13:26.730
the directions of edges. 
These are very simple but very, very 

163
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.640
interesting equation. 
Let us see some examples. 

164
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:36.586
So always when you do image processing, 
start with very simple examples to see 

165
00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:40.475
what's happening. 
And here is a very simple example. 

166
00:13:40.475 --> 00:13:44.049
White is the region. 
Then it's to be inpainted. 

167
00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:48.937
And you can see here that there is a very 
smooth continuation. 

168
00:13:48.937 --> 00:13:52.170
Really, really nice. 
A smooth continuation. 

169
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:57.452
It continues the boundaries nice. 
It, of course, continues the colors, 

170
00:13:57.452 --> 00:14:01.709
black and grey. 
But even more, more important, it really 

171
00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:06.439
completes the circle. 
It doesn't know that there is a circle 

172
00:14:06.439 --> 00:14:09.830
there. 
It just goes in the normal direction. 

173
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:14.254
Perpendicular to the normal direction in 
the edge direction. 

174
00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:17.425
Remember the gradient is in this 
direction. 

175
00:14:17.425 --> 00:14:21.480
The perpendicular to the gradient is in 
this direction. 

176
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.315
So it's going and it's filling in. 
Inside the region. 

177
00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:28.412
Propagating information in that 
direction. 

178
00:14:28.412 --> 00:14:33.352
Really, really nice result. 
Of course, if it works only in artificial 

179
00:14:33.352 --> 00:14:38.145
images it's not very good. 
Hopefully, it works on the, also on real 

180
00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:39.915
data. 
Here is an example. 

181
00:14:39.915 --> 00:14:42.570
What is being impainted? 
The letters. 

182
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.903
We wrote on top of this image. 
This is a nice image of New Orleans. 

183
00:14:47.903 --> 00:14:53.641
And we draw with a basic rough and tough 
and boom, the letters are gone. 

184
00:14:53.641 --> 00:14:59.782
So the regions to be painting are all 
these letters and we go inside and we 

185
00:14:59.782 --> 00:15:04.792
make the letters disappear. 
We're propagating information from 

186
00:15:04.792 --> 00:15:08.914
outside in. 
So hard to see here and now you get the 

187
00:15:08.914 --> 00:15:14.813
very nice image where we invented the 
information that is covered by the 

188
00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:18.845
letters. 
Based on information that is surrounding 

189
00:15:18.845 --> 00:15:21.900
the letters. 
Very nice result, I think. 

190
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:27.311
Here is another example of basically an 
image that has deteriorations and 

191
00:15:27.311 --> 00:15:31.114
degradation. 
The red are the images, the regions, that 

192
00:15:31.114 --> 00:15:35.721
we are going to in paint. 
Sometimes, you mark regions that are a 

193
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:39.158
bit larger than the actual missing 
information. 

194
00:15:39.158 --> 00:15:40.913
Look here. 
Is very thing. 

195
00:15:40.913 --> 00:15:44.643
You do it a bit larger. 
It's like giving an impulse. 

196
00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:49.542
So this is propagated from outside, in. 
You start from a, be far away. 

197
00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:53.491
It helps you have to move even more 
smooth as we want. 

198
00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:58.204
And here are the results. 
And it looks pretty good, some place you 

199
00:15:58.204 --> 00:16:03.974
might see a tiny error here because it's 
covering a lot of the eye of this girl, 

200
00:16:03.974 --> 00:16:09.311
so it's very difficult to invent 
information when there is nothing in the 

201
00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:14.215
surrounding area that hints about what 
needs to be basically put in. 

202
00:16:14.215 --> 00:16:19.669
But of course you get an extremely good. 
At least initial result looks almost 

203
00:16:19.669 --> 00:16:24.878
excellent and the a professional 
restorator you see different programs may 

204
00:16:24.878 --> 00:16:29.740
basically be able to go and repair only 
that tiny region if needed to. 

205
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.195
Sometimes, there's no need for that. 
Here is the original one. 

206
00:16:34.195 --> 00:16:38.428
We have already seen it. 
A person is jumping with a cable. 

207
00:16:38.428 --> 00:16:42.512
Now the cable is gone, and now you see a 
zooming region. 

208
00:16:42.512 --> 00:16:45.780
Once again, look how nice the socks 
continue. 

209
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:52.396
Very nice continuation of this thread H 
because that's what we wanted, we were 

210
00:16:52.396 --> 00:16:59.013
continuing HX that's exactly what we 
wanted, and that's exactly what this type 

211
00:16:59.013 --> 00:17:04.292
of algorithm does. 
So, on our example, just a special 

212
00:17:04.292 --> 00:17:08.500
effect, let's just look at what's 
happening here. 

213
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.830
And basically they're all gone. 
I'm going to just show you that again. 

214
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:17.692
There are people in the boat and they're 
all gone. 

215
00:17:17.692 --> 00:17:23.254
We're basically in-painting what's 
basically been covered by the people 

216
00:17:23.254 --> 00:17:27.193
sitting on the boat and basically they're 
all gone. 

217
00:17:27.193 --> 00:17:32.292
Again, in-painting means modifying an 
image in a form that is then 

218
00:17:32.292 --> 00:17:36.300
non-detectable, at least by the regular 
consumer. 

219
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:43.791
Here is another example of, we have 
scratches and now the scratches are gone 

220
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:48.424
basically, we basically removed those 
scratches. 

221
00:17:48.424 --> 00:17:56.112
We inpaint in the information from the 
surrounding areas and again, looks very 

222
00:17:56.112 --> 00:18:00.745
nice. 
It looks very natural as it was before it 

223
00:18:00.745 --> 00:18:04.241
was all scratched. 
Now there is one example. 

224
00:18:04.241 --> 00:18:09.476
And this is the last example I want to 
show in this video where it's actually 

225
00:18:09.476 --> 00:18:13.746
not very hard to detect the regions that 
need to be inpainted. 

226
00:18:13.746 --> 00:18:19.050
In other previous examples we, basically 
the user, defined somehow the regions. 

227
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:24.433
Now, this is an example, for example, of 
wireless transmission of images. 

228
00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:28.740
Remember, images are transmitted, are 
restored, using JPEG. 

229
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.740
JPEG works in blocks. 
What happens is, if when you're 

230
00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.124
transmitting an image, there's a signal 
drop. 

231
00:18:36.124 --> 00:18:40.662
For example, on the cell phone. 
So half a block gets dropped. 

232
00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:45.200
Now, signal drops are not very hard to 
detect, and basically. 

233
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.583
You, you have no signal and you detected 
it. 

234
00:18:48.583 --> 00:18:52.046
Okay? 
So when there's a drop you can say, hey, 

235
00:18:52.046 --> 00:18:56.610
I'm basic going to recover that block by 
mention painting. 

236
00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:02.887
And that's what we are simulating here. 
And this is the original and all these 

237
00:19:02.887 --> 00:19:09.219
blocks that you see here basically are 
dropped signals, simulation of dropped 

238
00:19:09.219 --> 00:19:13.084
signal. 
You see that there's no signal, you plug 

239
00:19:13.084 --> 00:19:18.182
that into a painting and then boom, you 
reconstruct your image. 

240
00:19:18.182 --> 00:19:22.870
Let me show you that again, you basically 
see signal drop. 

241
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.381
And you reconstruct. 
So basically you may have a better 

242
00:19:27.381 --> 00:19:33.533
cellular phone, a cellular phone that 
detect signal drop in images and boom 

243
00:19:33.533 --> 00:19:39.849
does imaging painting, this is still 
JPEG, still the person that is sending it 

244
00:19:39.849 --> 00:19:44.310
to you doesn't know. 
That the signal might drop. 

245
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.126
At the receiver end, you see a signal 
drop. 

246
00:19:47.126 --> 00:19:52.222
This actually can help even compression. 
You can drop on purpose some of the 

247
00:19:52.222 --> 00:19:57.452
blocks, because we know how to recover 
them with image in painting, and in that 

248
00:19:57.452 --> 00:20:00.670
way, you basically improve the 
compression ratio. 

249
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:06.169
Some blocks are very easy to recover, and 
then you can actually not even send them 

250
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:10.125
or not even store them. 
Makes the reconstruction a bit more 

251
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:15.020
computationally expensive, but makes the 
compression possibly much higher. 

252
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.665
So this is the last example from this 
video. 

253
00:20:17.665 --> 00:20:22.654
But there is one thing I haven't told you 
and that was on purpose just to keep you 

254
00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:25.240
wondering a bit. 
I gave you the equation of. 

255
00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.832
Image in painting, but here we have three 
colors. 

256
00:20:28.832 --> 00:20:34.280
How do we do that? 
How do we go from that equation that I 

257
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:41.325
gave you before to colors? 
Remember the equation was something like 

258
00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:47.410
IT equal gradient of ii and the I. 
In a product. 

259
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:54.070
Gradient I. 
Perpendicular, so. 

260
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.736
You can basically do this for each one of 
the channels. 

261
00:20:57.736 --> 00:21:01.402
Lets say in red, green, blue or in any 
other color space. 

262
00:21:01.402 --> 00:21:05.735
Or you can think about extending this to 
color images, to vectors. 

263
00:21:05.735 --> 00:21:11.201
We know the concept of gradient for color 
vectors and we can basically define the 

264
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:15.467
Laplacian for color vectors as well. 
So, both possibilities exist. 

265
00:21:15.467 --> 00:21:21.067
You can treat every color independently 
or you can try to use definition of 

266
00:21:21.067 --> 00:21:26.000
vectorial fields for these, every 
component here Laplacian and gradient in 

267
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.603
vectorial fashion. 
All the examples I show you, every color 

268
00:21:30.603 --> 00:21:35.211
is treated independently. 
So, this is an example of imaging pending 

269
00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:39.704
with partial differential equations. 
Next video, I'm going to show you an 

270
00:21:39.704 --> 00:21:44.396
example of energy painting with 
variational formulations that we learned 

271
00:21:44.396 --> 00:21:47.738
last week. 
Very simple variation of formulation that 

272
00:21:47.738 --> 00:21:52.688
will lead us to also a very nice energy 
painting technique based on the same 

273
00:21:52.688 --> 00:21:57.702
colors of propagation and boundaries. 
I'm looking forward to seeing you in the 

274
00:21:57.702 --> 00:21:59.052
next video. 
Thank you.
