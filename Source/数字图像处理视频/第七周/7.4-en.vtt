00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.157
Hello, and welcome back. 
In this video, what we're going to do, is 

2
00:00:04.157 --> 00:00:09.370
we're going to show a different technique 
of imaging painting that is based on 

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.198
calculus of variations. 
Instead of starting with a partial 

4
00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:18.147
differential equation from the very 
beginning, we're going to start with an 

5
00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:23.096
energy formulation that through the 
Eulerâ€“Lagrange is going to be transformed 

6
00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:27.188
into a differential equation. 
Now, we're going to keep the same 

7
00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:31.938
concepts that we learned before. 
If we have a region of missing 

8
00:00:31.938 --> 00:00:35.634
information. 
We're going to try to kind of mold in the 

9
00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:40.984
continuation of the edges as we represent 
here, and then fill in the color. 

10
00:00:40.984 --> 00:00:46.478
When I do both of them at the same time, 
as we are going to see in a second, but 

11
00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:49.370
we want to keep that important concept 
of. 

12
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.262
Continuing edges and then. 
Letting the color flow in, as we say, as 

13
00:00:55.262 --> 00:00:58.376
water. 
Actually, why do I say as water? 

14
00:00:58.376 --> 00:01:05.278
Because some of these equations are very 
related to the same type of mathematical 

15
00:01:05.278 --> 00:01:10.496
equations that model, the motion of 
fluids and gases in nature. 

16
00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:14.200
So this analogy of letting the pixel 
values. 

17
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.090
Flowing like water is not an artificial 
analogy because it is the same type of 

18
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.340
equations what we are doing here are 
transport equations. 

19
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.007
So we are going to basically derive a 
variation and formulation that does this 

20
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:33.945
type of process. 
Now, let us start by assuming that 

21
00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:37.902
somebody came and already told us the 
boundaries. 

22
00:01:37.902 --> 00:01:43.716
Somebody basically say, Hey, I don't know 
really what's happened in there. 

23
00:01:43.716 --> 00:01:48.400
But here are the boundaries. 
I'm going to extend them for you. 

24
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.537
And basically, it has given us the 
normalized gradient at every single pixel 

25
00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:58.252
inside the region that we need to 
inpaint. 

26
00:01:58.252 --> 00:02:04.470
Remember, the normalized gradient, we 
basically say that theta is the gradient. 

27
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.581
Divided by its magnitude. 
Now, we have to be a bit careful when the 

28
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:15.458
magnitude is zero. 
They say there is no gradient. 

29
00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:19.335
So, we basically leave that aside for the 
second. 

30
00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:25.070
So, this is what we were giving. 
Somebody gave us basically the gradient. 

31
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.905
And if you pluck that here, you get 
gradient square divided by gradient which 

32
00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:35.451
is equal to gradient. 
And the goal now is to find that image 

33
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:40.908
inside the region to be impainted. 
That is consistent with this gradient. 

34
00:02:40.908 --> 00:02:44.394
And we do that in a variation and 
formulation. 

35
00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:47.880
We basically are going to optimize for 
the image. 

36
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.997
In such a way that is consistent with the 
gradient that we were given. 

37
00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:58.017
That consistency is exactly what we have 
here. 

38
00:02:58.017 --> 00:03:04.767
When the image holds this, This, this 
becomes zero and then what's inside here 

39
00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:10.473
is as small as possible. 
Once again the basic idea is you find an 

40
00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:17.145
image, then when you take its gradient 
and you normalize it you get what was 

41
00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:20.744
given to you. 
So you look for consistency. 

42
00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:27.680
And the interval is inside the region to 
be painted and a small band around it. 

43
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.723
Where, basically we take the information 
to propagate in, and in that band we have 

44
00:03:33.723 --> 00:03:38.050
the real image, nurtures the even 
gradients, the real image. 

45
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.720
And that's why, as I said before, you 
basically optimize in the region, and as, 

46
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.973
in the region to be impainted and a small 
band around it. 

47
00:03:47.973 --> 00:03:52.673
So, this is your equation. 
You're looking for consistency of the 

48
00:03:52.673 --> 00:03:56.748
image with basically. 
The gradients that you were given. 

49
00:03:56.748 --> 00:04:00.289
The Euler-Lagrange of this, is what we 
have, here. 

50
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:05.748
That's the Euler-Lagrange of this 
equation and, as we have seen many times, 

51
00:04:05.748 --> 00:04:11.576
we basically deform the image in time 
according to the Euler-Lagrange and then 

52
00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:16.204
we go to steady state. 
And we get to steadystate, we basical 

53
00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:21.646
that the divergence, remember this is for 
divergence of, this vector. 

54
00:04:21.646 --> 00:04:27.656
We get, basically the divergense of the 
normalize image is equal to the 

55
00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:33.747
divergence of the, graudience, the 
normalized graudience that we were giving 

56
00:04:33.747 --> 00:04:39.675
and then we got an image that is 
consistent with the information that we 

57
00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:43.005
were given. 
That's exactly what we wanted. 

58
00:04:43.005 --> 00:04:48.228
Now, if we do that, for example for this 
image We basic remove the I. 

59
00:04:48.228 --> 00:04:50.366
There's no I here. 
We block it. 

60
00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:55.712
But remember somebody gave us the 
gradients, the normalized gradients which 

61
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.920
is equivalent to give us basically the 
edges. 

62
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.410
And then we can recover. 
The grade values are not exactly as we 

63
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.831
want them. 
We are going to repair that very soon. 

64
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:09.968
But you can observe the basic geometry 
here. 

65
00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:12.961
And that's because somebody gave us 
theta. 

66
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:17.310
Somebody gave us the normalized gradient. 
That's a first step. 

67
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.604
Now, we need to basically take those 
normalized gradients, because in real 

68
00:05:22.604 --> 00:05:28.189
scenario we don't have nothing in there. 
And here is the complete equation so. 

69
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.017
[SOUND]. 
Here is what we have before, we had 

70
00:05:32.017 --> 00:05:36.008
before. 
Somebody gave us theta, we basically 

71
00:05:36.008 --> 00:05:40.369
recover an image that is consistent with 
theta. 

72
00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:45.840
This is this term. 
What this term is doing. 

73
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.180
Is exactly helping us to propagate the 
gradients inside the region to be 

74
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.435
inpainted. 
I'm going to explain that more in just 

75
00:05:56.435 --> 00:06:00.865
one second. 
Again the integral is as before in this 

76
00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:07.639
same region and A, B and C are just some 
parameters that control basically the 

77
00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.458
weight between these two terms. 
And we are minimizing not only over 

78
00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:17.150
theta. 
Not, sorry, not on the over I, as within 

79
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.154
the previous slide, we also normalize 
over theta. 

80
00:06:21.154 --> 00:06:27.578
If we had theta, this is all we need, but 
here is, we're building the edges, and 

81
00:06:27.578 --> 00:06:32.000
the image consistent with the edges, at 
the same time. 

82
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.121
There, here is the consistency. 
And here is building the edges. 

83
00:06:37.121 --> 00:06:41.738
And here, what we have is as most 
continuation of edges. 

84
00:06:41.738 --> 00:06:46.103
As we saw, as we learn from professional 
restorators. 

85
00:06:46.103 --> 00:06:52.820
Let as look at this turn for a second. 
If theta is the normalized gradient. 

86
00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.407
As we write it here. 
What is the divergence of this? 

87
00:07:01.407 --> 00:07:08.866
We saw that in the previous week. 
What's the divergence of the normalized 

88
00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:12.940
gradient? 
Let's think for a second. 

89
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.180
That's the curvature. 
This term. 

90
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:24.386
Is curvature. 
Of what? 

91
00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:29.786
Of the leg lines of my image, which are 
kind of edges. 

92
00:07:29.786 --> 00:07:34.861
So we're saying. 
Propagate the edges inside in such a way 

93
00:07:34.861 --> 00:07:40.589
that the curvature doesn't go crazy. 
If it, if the curvature basically goes 

94
00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:44.873
crazy, then we're going to be paying a 
lot of penalty for that. 

95
00:07:44.873 --> 00:07:49.884
P is a parameter that says, how much 
penalty do we want to pay for that? 

96
00:07:49.884 --> 00:07:55.257
So basically, we're doing a smooth 
propagation of edges in such a way that 

97
00:07:55.257 --> 00:08:01.139
the curvature is relatively mild inside, 
and at the same time, we're recovering an 

98
00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:05.860
image that is consistent with those edges 
that we're propagating. 

99
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:11.693
This term is to make everything even 
smoother and more regular, and so it has 

100
00:08:11.693 --> 00:08:17.039
a mathematical justification. 
With this term, this compete formulation 

101
00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:23.495
you can prove a lot of beautiful math for 
it and without a term, the things become 

102
00:08:23.495 --> 00:08:27.746
a bit more difficult and are what is 
called ill-posed. 

103
00:08:27.746 --> 00:08:33.258
They're not very well defined. 
So it's a technical term that we add to 

104
00:08:33.258 --> 00:08:38.400
make this equation actually look okay. 
Now, how do we solve this? 

105
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.413
Euler-Lagrange equations. 
And now we have two unknowns, theta and 

106
00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:46.889
the image. 
It's exactly the same, you compute the 

107
00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:52.720
Euler-Lagrange, like, I is constant, you 
compute all the Euler-Lagrange for theta, 

108
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.367
that gives you one equation. 
And then you keep theta constant and you 

109
00:08:57.367 --> 00:09:01.677
compute Euler-Lagrange for I that gives 
you the second equation. 

110
00:09:01.677 --> 00:09:06.796
So instead of one equation as we have 
before when we knew theta, you get two 

111
00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:10.297
equations. 
One that is evolving eye, the other that 

112
00:09:10.297 --> 00:09:14.326
is evolving feet. 
And you are solving both of them at the 

113
00:09:14.326 --> 00:09:17.931
same time. 
So it's like fixing one for a short time, 

114
00:09:17.931 --> 00:09:22.384
solving for the other, fixing the other, 
solving for one of them. 

115
00:09:22.384 --> 00:09:25.000
then you iterate. 
And you get this. 

116
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.177
Copy. 
Partial differential equation on both I 

117
00:09:29.177 --> 00:09:34.666
and theta, but it is very elegant, 
because we can think about what we want, 

118
00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:40.080
and with a sign of variation of 
formulation that, that achieves that for 

119
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.314
us. 
We want the image to be consistent with 

120
00:09:43.314 --> 00:09:45.570
the edges. 
We've assigned that. 

121
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:51.202
We want the edges to continue smoothly. 
We know smoothness is curvature. 

122
00:09:51.202 --> 00:09:56.041
We design for that. 
We put that into an energy that penalizes 

123
00:09:56.041 --> 00:10:02.150
for not achieving what we want and then 
we compute the Euler-Lagrange and we 

124
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.700
solve that equation. 
Let us see some examples. 

125
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:14.280
Again we start by artificial examples, so 
we block these line. 

126
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:20.409
So basically, this is what we get. 
By blocking it, and by running this 

127
00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:26.004
equation we'll smoothly continue it. 
A very nice continuation. 

128
00:10:26.004 --> 00:10:32.974
Similar example as we had before, we 
block this and we get a smooth and nice 

129
00:10:32.974 --> 00:10:36.550
continuation of this. 
We do the same here. 

130
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.924
We block this cross and we get a smooth 
continuation. 

131
00:10:40.924 --> 00:10:47.443
Now you may ask: why did we get a smooth 
continuation of the bright and not the 

132
00:10:47.443 --> 00:10:50.992
dark? 
Now this is a deterministic algorithm 

133
00:10:50.992 --> 00:10:55.944
when you implement it, basically it chose 
one over the other. 

134
00:10:55.944 --> 00:11:02.711
There's no way for the algorithm to know 
which one is the one that you might want. 

135
00:11:02.711 --> 00:11:07.250
Here we have the famous at symbol. 
We block it and look. 

136
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:13.172
We get not the add symbol, we get this. 
Now, this is examples like the chair I 

137
00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:19.246
show in the very beginning of this week. 
The computer doesn't know the @ symbol. 

138
00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:24.226
The computer is just looking for the 
minimal energy to complete. 

139
00:11:24.226 --> 00:11:30.140
Now the completion, the feeling that 
painting is beautiful is perfectly fine. 

140
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:35.144
Is not the add symbol we started. 
But remember imaging painting is trying 

141
00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:40.050
to give you back something that looks 
okay and there's no way for the computer 

142
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.453
to know that what you wanted is to get 
back the @ symbol, not in this fashion. 

143
00:11:45.453 --> 00:11:50.174
So you get a perfectly fine, actually 
this has lower energy according to the 

144
00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:55.701
energy that we just defined that the @ 
symbol and that's why it went into that 

145
00:11:55.701 --> 00:11:58.467
one. 
So perfectly fine, but without this 

146
00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:04.292
higher level information of the @ symbol 
which cannot be achieved with these type 

147
00:12:04.292 --> 00:12:09.859
of local algorithms for inpainting. 
It works nice for artificial examples. 

148
00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:15.957
Let's see if he works for real ones. 
Here, there is a nice picture of Groucho 

149
00:12:15.957 --> 00:12:19.648
Marx. 
And then we have regions that we want to 

150
00:12:19.648 --> 00:12:23.018
in paint. 
Here, we kind of see an evolution. 

151
00:12:23.018 --> 00:12:28.876
And this is the result. 
A nice recover along filling in along 

152
00:12:28.876 --> 00:12:33.563
those regions. 
Another example as we have seen before, 

153
00:12:33.563 --> 00:12:37.857
we have letters and we get the letters 
removed. 

154
00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:44.343
So the basic image pictures are flowing 
in by solving this variational 

155
00:12:44.343 --> 00:12:48.684
formulation. 
Now, those are simple examples. 

156
00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:54.614
And I want to conclude these examples 
with going back to the very beginning 

157
00:12:54.614 --> 00:12:58.141
when I say. 
We are in painting, structure, and 

158
00:12:58.141 --> 00:13:01.347
colors. 
What about kind of, the noise, the 

159
00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:06.476
granularity of the image? 
This is one way of doing that, and even 

160
00:13:06.476 --> 00:13:10.082
going beyond that. 
So you start from an image. 

161
00:13:10.082 --> 00:13:14.170
And these are the regions that we want to 
in paint. 

162
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.565
You first take this image and decompose 
in two parts. 

163
00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:22.462
One, and I'm going to say in second how 
we do that. 

164
00:13:22.462 --> 00:13:28.101
Let me just explain the diagram first. 
One, it's like this was smooth. 

165
00:13:28.101 --> 00:13:31.418
It has no granularity. 
No texture at all. 

166
00:13:31.418 --> 00:13:35.150
And the others were all the texture has 
done. 

167
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.140
Okay? 
Now you in paint the structure part with 

168
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:46.167
the techniques I just mentioned to you. 
You basically continue the boundaries and 

169
00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:51.632
continue these flat colors inside. 
And you get a very beautiful 

170
00:13:51.632 --> 00:13:56.057
continuation. 
The texture, the granularity, you use a 

171
00:13:56.057 --> 00:14:00.310
technique that is designed to impend 
granularity. 

172
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.825
We're going to explain that technique 
actually in the next video. 

173
00:14:04.825 --> 00:14:09.995
So see for example how here the texture 
has been very nicely continued. 

174
00:14:09.995 --> 00:14:13.272
Here. 
And then you go and add those two again. 

175
00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:18.442
And you get that great reconstruction 
that has this structure continue. 

176
00:14:18.442 --> 00:14:23.176
Has the colors continue. 
Has also the texture and the granularity 

177
00:14:23.176 --> 00:14:26.453
continue. 
Here's the structure and the colors. 

178
00:14:26.453 --> 00:14:30.070
Here is the texture. 
How do we do this decomposition? 

179
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:35.740
There are a few techniques out there that 
follow something developed by Yves Meyer. 

180
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:41.072
Just to give one example and we get this 
decomposition into something which is 

181
00:14:41.072 --> 00:14:46.742
pitch-wise smooth, so it has not a lot of 
oscillations and variations and something 

182
00:14:46.742 --> 00:14:49.780
that has all the oscillations and 
variations. 

183
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.279
You in paint here with the techniques 
that I just showed to you. 

184
00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:57.865
Either the partial differential equations 
base one. 

185
00:14:57.865 --> 00:15:01.943
Or the variational one, for example. 
You in painted texture. 

186
00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:06.231
Here, the granularity was something we 
are going to discuss next. 

187
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:09.817
Which is kind of a cut and paste type of 
technique. 

188
00:15:09.817 --> 00:15:14.457
And then you add them back. 
And you get a beautiful reconstruction. 

189
00:15:14.457 --> 00:15:19.752
And you get everything in one image. 
So in the next video I'm going to talk a 

190
00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:23.149
bit more about this type of cut and paste 
technique. 

191
00:15:23.149 --> 00:15:27.592
You actually already know it. 
And I'm going to remind you what it is in 

192
00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:30.793
the next video. 
I'm looking forward to to that. 

193
00:15:30.793 --> 00:15:32.100
Thank you very much.
