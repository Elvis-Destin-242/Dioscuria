00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.952
Hello and welcome back. Let us now 
introduce a different concept into 

2
00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:09.043
imaging painting. 
Basically, we're going to do a Smart Cut 

3
00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:12.272
and Paste. 
We're going to first introduce the 

4
00:00:12.272 --> 00:00:17.584
concept and then see how we obtain 
excellent results by merging that with 

5
00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:23.397
the type of variation and formulations 
that we just talked about in the previous 

6
00:00:23.397 --> 00:00:26.845
videos. 
So, why do we need an another type of 

7
00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:29.869
impainting? 
There's a number of reasons. 

8
00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.520
But one of them is in the example that we 
showed in the previous video. 

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.128
We discussed the fact that. 
PDEs and variational formulations are 

10
00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:44.740
excellent tools for impainting smooth 
regions. 

11
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.274
They're not as good for impainting 
texture as we see here. 

12
00:00:49.274 --> 00:00:55.037
That we need to basically extend this 
nice texture inside the region to be 

13
00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:58.649
impainted. 
And that's where this other type of 

14
00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.720
techniques become extremely powerful. 
Let me blow this region so we can explain 

15
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.007
what's going on. 
We need now to inpaint inside here and we 

16
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:12.719
see that there are plotters that we want 
to extend. 

17
00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.960
We could actually write partial 
differential equations that extend that 

18
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.619
flow towards this region. 
But it would be much harder to write a 

19
00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.224
partial differential equation that 
extends this type of texture that goes in 

20
00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:32.076
multiple directions. 
But we have another technique. 

21
00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:36.790
Remember we talk about non-local means 
for image denoising. 

22
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.542
We happen to exploit the same type of 
approach but for image impainting. 

23
00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:47.715
Here is the basic idea. 
Let us assume that we take a a patch 

24
00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:52.137
here. 
This patch is very particular. 

25
00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:57.403
It contains some known information and 
some unknown information. 

26
00:01:57.403 --> 00:02:03.573
Now in the same way as the non-local 
means, I can go around and looking for 

27
00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:09.742
similar patches but, in this case, I do 
the comparison only in the region of 

28
00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:14.103
known pixels. 
So, for example, I basically take a patch 

29
00:02:14.103 --> 00:02:18.710
of the same size as here but I only look 
at this region. 

30
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.545
And I say is this region similar to this 
region and I keep going around, for 

31
00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:30.190
example I might take a byte here. 
And once again I look only at this 

32
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.100
region. 
So, at least they translate the known 

33
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.121
region towards dark patch and I keep 
going and I find one or more patches dark 

34
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:46.454
in the known region, they're basically 
equal or very similar. 

35
00:02:46.454 --> 00:02:51.520
Let us assume that I find one, for 
example I find it here. 

36
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.920
And we draw the region and we say okay, 
this is very similar to this here. 

37
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.480
So how can I fill this region? 
I basically copy this. 

38
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.360
The unknown becomes the known part of the 
matching part. 

39
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.548
I can copy the whole region. 
I can copy only a few border pixels and I 

40
00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:20.701
can copy only from one part or I can find 
a number of patches that are similar and 

41
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.333
copy their average or any other type of 
function. 

42
00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:28.632
But the concept is the same concept as in 
all local means. 

43
00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:34.043
Find similar patches but now similarity's 
based only on the known region. 

44
00:03:34.043 --> 00:03:39.189
Once you find similar patches. 
Copy the unknown region towards here. 

45
00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.326
When we do that, we finish and we know 
here. 

46
00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:47.142
And we can keep propagating. 
This now becomes known because I just 

47
00:03:47.142 --> 00:03:51.008
filled that in. 
And then we can keep going inside and 

48
00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:56.918
keep going inside and keep going inside. 
So a basic idea is that we look at every 

49
00:03:56.918 --> 00:04:00.843
unknown pixel. 
We start from pixels that have a lot of 

50
00:04:00.843 --> 00:04:03.673
known area surrounding it. 
We fill them. 

51
00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:09.117
And then we keep going with the other and 
the other pixels, until we finish 

52
00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:14.415
basically filling in everything. 
And let me go back to the previous slide. 

53
00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:19.140
And we basically see. 
That we feel nicely the texture, we also 

54
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.740
feel nicely the texture here. 
And we actually have feel the texture in 

55
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.580
a very nice fashion all around. 
Just by the same concept as the non-local 

56
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.349
means. 
Now, that, we can actually combine with 

57
00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.316
variational formulations. 
What I just told you, we can write in a 

58
00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:44.749
variational formulation, but we can keep 
adding additional constraints. 

59
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:50.492
For example, we could say okay, if this 
patch found a friend here, meaning a 

60
00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:56.624
patch that is very similar to it, I want 
to make sure that the patch next to it, 

61
00:04:56.624 --> 00:05:00.660
let me just use a different pen. 
I want to make sure. 

62
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.848
That the bunch next to it finds a similar 
part next to the previous one. 

63
00:05:08.848 --> 00:05:14.566
So that would help me. 
In this search it will make it faster but 

64
00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:20.385
it will also force that this region is 
smoothly copied here and that can be 

65
00:05:20.385 --> 00:05:24.980
posed in a variational formulation by for 
example by asking. 

66
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.177
That the translation vectors. 
So this part got translated from here. 

67
00:05:30.177 --> 00:05:35.375
This part got translated from here. 
We have two translation vectors. 

68
00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:39.719
We can force the translation vectors to 
change smoothly. 

69
00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:45.227
And that's, it's a variation in 
formulation, for example, we can take the 

70
00:05:45.227 --> 00:05:51.122
derivatives of the coordinates of the 
translation vectors and penalize when 

71
00:05:51.122 --> 00:05:56.708
those derivatives are too high. 
That means that basically, you're jumping 

72
00:05:56.708 --> 00:05:59.525
all around to get those. 
New patches. 

73
00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:05.659
All these concepts can be incorporated 
into one variation or formulation, can 

74
00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:10.120
become very rich. 
We can incorporate the PDEs type, or the 

75
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.652
variation and formulation type of smooth 
continuation that we saw in the previous 

76
00:06:16.652 --> 00:06:20.236
videos. 
We can incorporate this Smart Cut and 

77
00:06:20.236 --> 00:06:24.140
Paste all in one large variation and 
formulation. 

78
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:31.044
And then you obtain very nice results as 
we see here, we basically have an object 

79
00:06:31.044 --> 00:06:37.181
that has been removed, as we see here, by 
this combination of variational 

80
00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:43.543
formulations with Smart Cut and Paste. 
Here is another example and we are going 

81
00:06:43.543 --> 00:06:48.877
to see this example again in the next 
video is going to exp, as I'm going to 

82
00:06:48.877 --> 00:06:52.687
explain soon. 
Again here, remember this image looks 

83
00:06:52.687 --> 00:06:59.163
perfect that's because impainting, but we 
basically have removed this lamp from 

84
00:06:59.163 --> 00:07:02.440
this image and got a very, very nice 
result. 

85
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.815
Here is yet another example where we 
basically remove the bars. 

86
00:07:07.815 --> 00:07:13.532
And we get a nice result by this 
combination of Cut and Paste in a 

87
00:07:13.532 --> 00:07:19.547
variational formulation. 
By now we have basically seen two type 

88
00:07:19.547 --> 00:07:25.713
of, or three type of concepts. 
PDEs and variational formulations, that's 

89
00:07:25.713 --> 00:07:31.204
almost one group because the standard 
variation of formulation leads to PDEs. 

90
00:07:31.204 --> 00:07:36.434
And then we saw this Smart Cut and Paste. 
And we saw how we can combine them all 

91
00:07:36.434 --> 00:07:40.225
together to get very, very nice image and 
painting results. 

92
00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:45.324
Before I show you some video impainting 
concepts, I want to demo in painting in 

93
00:07:45.324 --> 00:07:48.200
real time. 
And I'm going to do that in the next 

94
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.273
video. 
Looking forward to seeing you again then. 

95
00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:51.927
Thank you.
