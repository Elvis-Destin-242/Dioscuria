00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.127
Hello, and welcome back. 
This week we are going to be talking 

2
00:00:04.127 --> 00:00:09.124
about image and video inpainting. 
In contrast with the topics that we 

3
00:00:09.124 --> 00:00:15.134
described last week, where we performed a 
description of fundamental tools to solve 

4
00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:20.492
a number of problems, like an isotropic 
diffusion, active contours, and even 

5
00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:24.620
image inpainting. This week is about a 
particular problem. 

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.734
It's not about tools for multiple 
problems, 

7
00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:32.685
it's about solving one particular problem 
in image and video processing. 

8
00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:37.946
Of course, some of the tools that we are 
going to be using for this might be used 

9
00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:42.128
for other techniques, 
and we often learn from the solutions of 

10
00:00:42.128 --> 00:00:46.918
a problem towards another problem. 
But it's a very important difference 

11
00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:51.842
between providing for the mental tools 
for solving multiple problems, and 

12
00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:56.564
solving one particular problem. 
So what is image and video inpainting? 

13
00:00:56.564 --> 00:01:02.352
And let's start with image inpainting. 
Image inpainting is basically the art of 

14
00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:05.532
changing an image in a non-detectable 
form. 

15
00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:10.857
So here we see a painting that has a lot 
of degradation, and here is the 

16
00:01:10.857 --> 00:01:16.035
restoration of that painting. 
This was of course done by professionals 

17
00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:19.437
manually. 
It's a painting, it's not a picture, was 

18
00:01:19.437 --> 00:01:24.836
not done in the computer, although the 
computer can help as well, as we're 

19
00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:29.422
going to see it later on. 
When you go and see this picture in the 

20
00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:32.676
museum, 
you'll believe it's the original picture. 

21
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:38.017
Some experts actually might be able to 
notice the difference, and be able to see 

22
00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:43.090
the regions that were actually inpainted 
or filled in with information from 

23
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.029
different regions. 
But the basic idea is that in inpainting, 

24
00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:52.369
we show you an image or a video, and we 
make you believe that's the original one. 

25
00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.623
In this case, it's to solve degradations. 
Inpainting, it's sometimes also called 

26
00:01:57.623 --> 00:02:00.802
fill in, 
because we're filling in the regions of 

27
00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:03.650
problems, 
the regions of deterioration with 

28
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.353
informations from this surrounding. 
And we are going to see that, sometimes, 

29
00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:13.454
with fill in with information from the 
near areas sometimes with information 

30
00:02:13.454 --> 00:02:18.885
from far away areas from the whole image. 
There's even techniques that do image in 

31
00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:23.390
painting using database of images where 
you look for similar things. 

32
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.967
So, this is one example of what image in 
painting needs to be done. 

33
00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:31.990
Remember, it's modifying an image in a 
non-detectable form. 

34
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.671
And when we say non-detectable, we say at 
least by the non-experts. 

35
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:41.706
Here is another example. A lot has been 
done to this image, basically to 

36
00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:46.458
transform it into this one. 
Of course it has been inpainted, you see 

37
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:51.849
these regions have been filled in. 
But also there were color corrections and 

38
00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.097
other things, but this illustrates yet 
another example of image inpainting. 

39
00:02:57.097 --> 00:03:02.062
Look at all these regions that have 
missing information and that were 

40
00:03:02.062 --> 00:03:08.875
basically restored, inpainted, filled in 
with nice information that looks like 

41
00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:12.530
natural in the surrounding region of the 
image. 

42
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.808
Of course, it's natural to extend these 
to regular photography, in particular 

43
00:03:17.808 --> 00:03:22.676
when we were talking about pictures, and 
not digital pictures, but analog 

44
00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:27.612
pictures, and here we see examples. 
Some of examples like here have a few 

45
00:03:27.612 --> 00:03:31.040
additional restoration techniques, but we 
see these. 

46
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.491
For example, the picture was turned into 
two pieces, then was put together and to 

47
00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:41.846
repair that, you basically see that it 
was inpainted. 

48
00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:47.733
A region of missing information or 
undesirable information was filled in 

49
00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:52.007
with other types of information. 
We see here the same. 

50
00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:55.520
There is a scratch. 
Now the scratch is gone. 

51
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.946
And here there is a similar example like 
this. 

52
00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:04.682
Basically, the picture was folded, and 
when you unfold it, you see this kind of 

53
00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:08.034
scratch in the middle and then here its 
gone. 

54
00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:13.695
So, these are all examples of image 
impending to restore basically the image 

55
00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:18.715
to a much nicer looking image. 
Of course, this is an example that we saw 

56
00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:23.878
in the first week, where image inpainting 
is done with a completely different 

57
00:04:23.878 --> 00:04:26.935
target. 
In this case, and this illustrates the 

58
00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:30.400
idea of modifying an image in an 
undetectable form. 

59
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.427
In this case, we see nothing, nothing 
wrong with this image, that we know, if 

60
00:04:35.427 --> 00:04:40.609
you remember from the first week of 
class, that basically this was the 

61
00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:46.250
original image. 
So what was inpainted now is the object 

62
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.628
that the user wants to remove from the 
image. 

63
00:04:49.628 --> 00:04:55.559
So basically, this region becomes the 
region of missing information that we are 

64
00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:00.139
going to inpaint in, 
and we need to recover the water, and we 

65
00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.418
need to recover the column. 
So we need to recover texture, 

66
00:05:04.418 --> 00:05:09.073
we need to recover structure, 
straight lines and water that is 

67
00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:14.254
basically non-straight lines. 
So very different types of informations 

68
00:05:14.254 --> 00:05:21.014
need to be filled in, inpainted, in order 
to solve this problem of removing 

69
00:05:21.014 --> 00:05:24.515
objects. 
And we discuss in the first week, this is 

70
00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:30.054
used all the times in the movie industry, 
I show you a few examples of objects that 

71
00:05:30.054 --> 00:05:36.002
need to be removed in the movie industry. 
Here is yet another example from this 

72
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:42.341
era, where basically we see here, a 
picture of Lenin, and a picture, and next 

73
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:47.413
to him there is Trotsky. 
And here, basically, Trotsky has been 

74
00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:52.991
removed from the picture. 
So once again an object has been removed 

75
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:57.810
from the picture. 
And, yeah, you can have multiple examples 

76
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.978
of these. For example in this website, or 
the website that was linked in the 

77
00:06:03.978 --> 00:06:08.502
previous slide. 
So again inpainting in order to remove 

78
00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:13.130
objects that from the image or from the 
video. 

79
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.447
I want to explain something that 
inpainting, in its basic form, cannot do. 

80
00:06:18.447 --> 00:06:23.691
I don't want to, you have the wrong 
understanding that inpainting is an 

81
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:28.634
extremely smart technique that can fill 
in with whatever you want. 

82
00:06:28.634 --> 00:06:32.080
So let me use this example to illustrate 
that. 

83
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.786
Here, this person was removed, 
and then it was inpainted. 

84
00:06:36.786 --> 00:06:43.290
So when you look at this image, it holds 
everything that inpainting is about, 

85
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.678
modifying the image in an undetectable 
form. 

86
00:06:46.678 --> 00:06:51.837
But look what happened here. 
When the person was removed, two chairs 

87
00:06:51.837 --> 00:06:55.072
were brought in. 
This is done by an expert. 

88
00:06:55.072 --> 00:07:00.077
It's not done by the computer. 
There's no way for the computer to 

89
00:07:00.077 --> 00:07:03.620
understand that what you want here are 
chairs. 

90
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.357
Maybe in a very, very advanced technique, 
when you basically provide a lot of side 

91
00:07:09.357 --> 00:07:13.040
information, 
you could, in the computer, with programs 

92
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.723
like Photoshop, 
cut chairs from here and put them here. 

93
00:07:16.723 --> 00:07:20.193
And this is the kind of stuff that was 
done here. 

94
00:07:20.193 --> 00:07:24.443
So it's a cut and paste, 
and we are going to see how to do that. 

95
00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:30.110
But basically, inpainting, does not have 
that high level knowledge of what needs 

96
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.054
to be there. 
The computer and the user can interact to 

97
00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:38.770
basically bring that into the scene, as 
we're going to see later on. 

98
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.559
But if you don't interact, 
if you just say, do something with this 

99
00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:47.022
region, 
the computer does not know what is that 

100
00:07:47.022 --> 00:07:50.190
you want, 
why is that you want chairs there, 

101
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.980
and not, for example, green, 
not, for example, some of the background. 

102
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.214
But with interaction with the user, we 
might be able to do this, 

103
00:07:59.214 --> 00:08:03.180
kind of a cut and paste. 
So, this is about image inpainting. 

104
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.356
In the next video, I'm going to show you 
that we are actually familiar, in nature, 

105
00:08:08.356 --> 00:08:13.128
with image and video inpainting, and 
that's actually very interesting. 

106
00:08:13.128 --> 00:08:16.221
See you in the next video. 
Thank you very much.
