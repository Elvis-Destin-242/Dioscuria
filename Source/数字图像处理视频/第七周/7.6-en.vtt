Hello and Welcome back. 
I am going to show you now an example of 

2
00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:10.787
imaging painting inside Adobe Photoshop. 
Adobe has implemented a number of types 

3
00:00:10.787 --> 00:00:15.593
of image in painting algorithms. 
Some are based on partial differential 

4
00:00:15.593 --> 00:00:19.655
equations of the type that we showed in 
the previous videos. 

5
00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:24.732
Actually, they used a higher order 
partial differential equation as we have 

6
00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:29.911
seen in one of the videos in this class. 
And also, they have implemented this 

7
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:34.991
smart cut and paste type of techniques 
that we show in the previous video. 

8
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:39.454
So let's see an example. 
In particular, we are using the tool that 

9
00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:44.191
is called the Healing Brush, 
and it has a number of options, as I just 

10
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:47.349
described. 
Some based on partial differential 

11
00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:52.801
equation, some based on cut and paste. 
And what we see here is one of the images 

12
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:57.512
they show in the previous video, 
this was the image to be in painted, we 

13
00:00:57.512 --> 00:01:01.859
want to remove this object. 
This is the result that they show in the 

14
00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.055
previous video. 
It was not obtained with Photoshop. 

15
00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:10.616
It was obtained with similar techniques 
of smart cut and paste and variation and 

16
00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:14.004
formulations. 
So, lets see how we can apply the Healing 

17
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.881
Brush. 
Now, in real time in the demo, to obtain 

18
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:21.355
similar results of removing this. 
So, the basic idea, I hope you can see 

19
00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:24.999
the circle there. 
Let me just put it in a nice background, 

20
00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:28.810
so you can see it. 
And the basic idea, is you kind of start 

21
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.269
painting what you want to be removed. 
I'm going to release now, and in 

22
00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:39.017
thinking, and it's gone. 
It's basically gone, and it's kind of the 

23
00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:43.290
background starts to appear. We'll just 
do a bit more. 

24
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.020
I paint around, I brush, 
and is working, and is disappearing, 

25
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.698
and is starting to look like this. 
Again, remember this was not the 

26
00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:58.171
original. 
This was [INAUDIBLE] by the techniques we 

27
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:01.218
describe and now is happening in real 
time. 

28
00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:06.779
Let me just do one more. 
And you see, it's starting to disappear. 

29
00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:09.793
And it's very nicely [INAUDIBLE] filled 
in. 

30
00:02:09.793 --> 00:02:14.961
And we can keep going until we make 
everything that we don't want, every 

31
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:19.268
object that we don't want, 
we make it disappear by basically 

32
00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:22.929
blending information from the background 
inside it. 

33
00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:27.881
So, this is a nice demo of something that 
is available with Photoshop. 

34
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:31.327
Thank you very much. 
I see you in the next video.
