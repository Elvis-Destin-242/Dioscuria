00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.175
Hello, and welcome back. 
We actually see inpainting in nature all 

2
00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:09.260
the time. 
Let me show you some examples. 

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.096
What do you see here? 
You'll probably see a rock, and nothing 

4
00:00:14.096 --> 00:00:18.566
else than a rock. 
But there's actually something hiding in 

5
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:22.497
that rock. 
Let me just show that to you, or at least 

6
00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:27.045
help you to see it. 
There is actually a fish hiding in that 

7
00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:30.436
rock. 
You might be able to see it. I hope you 

8
00:00:30.436 --> 00:00:32.441
do, 
but I'm going to help you. 

9
00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:38.299
You can see the eyes here, you can see 
the tailfin here. The whole fish is in 

10
00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.534
here. 
Pretty amazing isn't it? 

11
00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:44.080
That's camouflage, but that's also 
inpainting. 

12
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.417
The fish has inpainted itself in order to 
get camouflage. 

13
00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:54.099
It has basically, it's kind of object 
removal in nature. 

14
00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:58.500
Pretty amazing. We also see that with 
octopuses. 

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.814
I'm going to give you another example of 
how amazing this fish is. 

16
00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:07.881
This is not a very high quality image, 
but still it's going to illustrate how 

17
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:11.647
amazing this fish is. 
The fish was now, not in nature as 

18
00:01:11.647 --> 00:01:16.989
before, but basically in a very nice fish 
tank, was basically put, an experiment 

19
00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:21.447
done by Ramachandran and collaborators, 
on top of polka dots. 

20
00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:27.704
So it's basically a piece of paper or 
basically something that is colored with 

21
00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:32.136
dots, as we see here. 
It's very interesting that if you have 

22
00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:37.460
started here, for example, the fish has 
turned around, has created two polka 

23
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.068
dots. 
In its own body. 

24
00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:45.078
And once again I apologize for the 
relatively low quality of this image that 

25
00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:49.840
was scanned from a paper. 
It's just kind of a long process to get 

26
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.289
it into the computer. 
And it's also turning around to put 

27
00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.191
basically its eyes on top of one of the 
polkadots. 

28
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:02.094
So basically the fish is trying to 
("inpaint) himself, 

29
00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:07.718
trying to camouflage itself so it cannot 
be seen by predators. 

30
00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:13.220
So we see inpainting in nature, fish, 
octopuses and others. 

31
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.655
We actually are doing inpainting all the 
time. 

32
00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:21.552
When you are watching this video, you're 
actually doing in painting. 

33
00:02:21.552 --> 00:02:25.459
Why is that? 
When we have, when we remember that we 

34
00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.838
learn about the human eye, in the retina, 
in the back of the eye there's a region 

35
00:02:31.838 --> 00:02:35.905
with no sensors, no sensors at all. 
No cones, no rods. 

36
00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:42.204
That is kind of the region where the 
sensors basically send the cables back to 

37
00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:45.473
the brain. 
So there's actually no sensors. 

38
00:02:45.473 --> 00:02:49.061
So what should happen if you have no 
sensors? 

39
00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:55.217
We should actually see a hole in the 
visual world, where basically you would 

40
00:02:55.217 --> 00:03:00.720
be watching this video and there would 
kind of a region of missing information 

41
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.526
because there are no sensors. 
But the humans are all the time filling 

42
00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:11.099
in that region by different techniques 
that the visual system does and actually 

43
00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.253
you can do those exercises. 
I took these images from the website that 

44
00:03:16.253 --> 00:03:20.773
is provided here. 
And the basic idea is that if you manage 

45
00:03:20.773 --> 00:03:23.423
to fixate. 
Basically if you manage. 

46
00:03:23.423 --> 00:03:29.113
You stand like a meter away from the 
screen and you manage to fixate the 

47
00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:32.152
basically a point. 
Like this point here. 

48
00:03:32.152 --> 00:03:37.296
So you concentrate on fixating your 
visual system into that point. 

49
00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:41.271
After a while you will see that the sun 
disappears. 

50
00:03:41.271 --> 00:03:48.578
So you're basically forcing your system 
to not in- paint the region that 

51
00:03:48.578 --> 00:03:54.448
basically there is no receptors. 
If you don't do that, if you don't 

52
00:03:54.448 --> 00:03:57.339
fixate, 
you basically see the sun with no 

53
00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.866
problem. 
The exercise is to try to stop the visual 

54
00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:05.944
system from doing in painting. 
Here is another exercise you could fixate 

55
00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:08.906
here. 
You might be able to basically pause 

56
00:04:08.906 --> 00:04:11.728
right now, 
or after we finish this video, 

57
00:04:11.728 --> 00:04:17.370
you might be able to go back, pause here, 
and then play with your distance to the 

58
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.403
screen. 
Fixate here, concentrate on fixating 

59
00:04:20.403 --> 00:04:25.270
that, and you might be able to see, for 
example the ear of Van Gogh disappears, 

60
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.502
or basically, the sun disappears. 
So you're forcing the visual system not 

61
00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:33.991
to inpaint. 
Otherwise, we're in painting all the 

62
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:37.044
times. 
We don't see those problems that, we 

63
00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:40.460
don't see holes when we are looking at a 
scene. 

64
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.640
So these are just examples that we 
actually have image and video inpainting 

65
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.961
when we're watching at the regular scene 
that's basically our video coming into 

66
00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:53.481
our eyes. 
Examples of that in nature. 

67
00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:57.681
So now we're ready to see how the 
computer does in painting. 

68
00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:00.971
Thank you. 
I will see you in the next video for 

69
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:01.322
that.
