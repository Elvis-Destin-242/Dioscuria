00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.839
Hello and welcome back. 
I just want to spend a few minutes 

2
00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:10.073
explaining some of the concepts that we 
learn about curves on the plane, but now 

3
00:00:10.073 --> 00:00:13.671
surfaces in 3D. 
so its going to be a much shorter video 

4
00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:19.402
than the previous one, and we're going to 
be discussing Surfaces instead of curves. 

5
00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:24.377
Just a couple of concepts. 
Surfaces are really beautiful, and we 

6
00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:30.536
could spend years, some people spend all 
their life, studying surfaces, but once 

7
00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:36.932
again, we only have time for a few key 
concepts that will help us to understand, 

8
00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:42.539
for example, active surfaces, how to do 
segmentation of volumes in three 

9
00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.812
dimensional images. 
again, just a few concepts. 

10
00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:54.275
We have a surface us on a surface. 
Basically, we are only going to be 

11
00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:58.879
talking about, talking about surfaces in 
three dimensions, 

12
00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.371
and basically on the surface we can draw 
curves. Here we have curves. 

13
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:10.509
Now basically, each one of these curves 
is in 3D now, so you have to have X, Y 

14
00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.740
and Z. 
But we basically have the surface. 

15
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.624
Imagine that the surface is basically 
floating on a plane. 

16
00:01:18.624 --> 00:01:24.856
So the way we parameterize the surface is 
now with two parameters, U and V. 

17
00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:30.246
Remember, for curves, we have only one P, 
for surfaces we have two. 

18
00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:36.140
So we basically are on the plane. 
So we have U and V. 

19
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:44.108
On the plane, for each U and each V, we 
have a X coordinate, Y coordinate and Z 

20
00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:49.180
coordinate, and that's how we represent a 
surface. 

21
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.910
Two parameters, three coordinates in 
curves we have one parameters, 

22
00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.023
two coordinates, because we were on the 
plane we can have curves in 3D that would 

23
00:02:01.023 --> 00:02:05.250
be one parameter, three coordinates, for 
example this one. 

24
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.903
So that's a surface. 
Now let's define normal area, and things 

25
00:02:09.903 --> 00:02:14.478
like that on the surface. 
But if we have curves, we can take 

26
00:02:14.478 --> 00:02:17.735
derivatives, as we were doing on the 
plane. 

27
00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:23.940
So we can take a derivative, according to 
the U parameter and according to the V 

28
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.662
parameter. 
So we can basically be on a curve and 

29
00:02:27.662 --> 00:02:33.246
basically say, let's just take a 
derivative of that curve, according to U 

30
00:02:33.246 --> 00:02:38.615
and according to V. 
If we do the cross product of these two 

31
00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:44.362
vectors, we get the third vector 
perpendicular to these two. 

32
00:02:44.362 --> 00:02:50.888
Once again, basic algebra. 
So the normal is the cross product of the 

33
00:02:50.888 --> 00:02:54.512
two. 
So, the derivative of S according to U is 

34
00:02:54.512 --> 00:02:57.843
tangent. 
The derivative S according to V is 

35
00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:01.715
tangent. 
They will define a plane which is tangent 

36
00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:07.058
to the surface at this point. 
If we do the cross product between them, 

37
00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:12.402
we get a normal to the surface. 
And again, we are going to normalize that 

38
00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:16.120
because we're interested in unit length 
normals. 

39
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.647
So we have derivatives which means time 
change and then the normal if we have 

40
00:03:22.647 --> 00:03:29.677
derivatives we can for example define the 
element of area we know that then once we 

41
00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:34.495
have two vectors. 
The determinant of the matrix composed by 

42
00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:40.438
those vectors, basically defines the area 
of the parallegram that we see here. 

43
00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:44.418
So if that is infinitesimal, we have 
elements of area. 

44
00:03:44.418 --> 00:03:49.985
If that's integrated across multiple, 
across long regions, then we have the 

45
00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:52.693
total area. 
So, same type of concepts. 

46
00:03:52.693 --> 00:03:56.228
We have length on the plane, we have 
areas here. 

47
00:03:56.228 --> 00:04:02.171
We also have length, because the surface, 
it's just a lot of curves, nothing else 

48
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:06.158
than that, nicely organized. 
So once again, here is the 

49
00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:12.175
parameterization, and here is the normal. 
Let's see the example of something that 

50
00:04:12.175 --> 00:04:18.300
you are familiar with, which is basically 
graphs. The same way that we saw graphs 

51
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.822
on the plane, we can see graphs in three 
dimensional space. 

52
00:04:22.822 --> 00:04:26.370
So we have a coordinate system, 
X, 

53
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.200
Y, and Z, and basically we define a graph 
that's again floating on space. 

54
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.454
So our parametrization is XU, equal to U. 
Basically X is one of the parameters, YV 

55
00:04:39.454 --> 00:04:45.708
equal to V, and then Z basically the 
height of the surface, or in this case 

56
00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:53.020
the graph or the function, is just a 
function of these two, a particular case. 

57
00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.072
Think about an image, for example. 
An image is a particular surface, it's a 

58
00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:04.807
function. 
So, the plane of the image is X and Y, or 

59
00:05:04.807 --> 00:05:09.358
U and V. 
The grey values of the image is the 

60
00:05:09.358 --> 00:05:13.316
height means Z. 
So you can think about images as 

61
00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:16.698
surfaces, 
in a particular case, as functions or 

62
00:05:16.698 --> 00:05:19.418
graphs. 
And that's a very interesting 

63
00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:22.874
interpretation. 
We can basically compute things. 

64
00:05:22.874 --> 00:05:28.020
We can compute the normal of an image, as 
we saw in the previous slide. 

65
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.108
Basically we treat the image as a 
surface. 

66
00:05:31.108 --> 00:05:35.078
We take derivatives, we compute the 
normal of an image. 

67
00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:39.931
So we bring a lot of concepts of 
differential geometry into image 

68
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:42.980
processing. 
Now what about curvatures? 

69
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:50.233
So the basic idea is very simple. 
Once again we have curves. If you have a 

70
00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:53.974
curve, 
you can take first derivative according 

71
00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:59.870
to our link. This is a curve in 3D, basic 
same concept and second derivative. 

72
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.690
Second derivative would basically view 
the curvature of that particular curve 

73
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.152
that you do. 
For example, this one. 

74
00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:13.897
No sometimes you want to project that 
curvature, remember first derivative is 

75
00:06:13.897 --> 00:06:18.374
tangent, second derivative is 
perpendicular to the curve, not 

76
00:06:18.374 --> 00:06:23.299
necessarily to the plane. 
You have a curve there's a lot of things 

77
00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:29.417
that can be perpendicular to that, so you 
can take it and project it to the normal 

78
00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:32.850
or the perpendicular of the plane if you 
wish. 

79
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.760
And that's basically something that's 
called the normal curvature. 

80
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.490
So you take the curve, you take second 
derivative, that gives you a vector and 

81
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.103
you project that vector into the 
perpendicular to the surface. 

82
00:06:48.103 --> 00:06:54.055
But that's about basically maybe you are 
thinking about a curve but if I have a 

83
00:06:54.055 --> 00:06:56.511
point. 
Let me just make that here. 

84
00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:01.050
If I have a point on the surface, they're 
are multiple curves. 

85
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.620
On the surface that go through that point 
so look at all the curve. 

86
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:12.334
There are multiple of them. So what 
exactly defines the curvature at that 

87
00:07:12.334 --> 00:07:16.565
point? 
It turns out that there is one of these 

88
00:07:16.565 --> 00:07:23.740
curves, that when we treat it at a curve 
and we compute the curvature, it's the 

89
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.982
smallest possible. 
And there is another curve that is the 

90
00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:33.967
largest possible. 
So we basically define the principal 

91
00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:38.185
curvatures of a surface in the following 
way. 

92
00:07:38.185 --> 00:07:45.591
You're in a point, and you basically try 
all the possible curves on the surface 

93
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:51.403
that go around that point, and you basic 
compute the curvature. 

94
00:07:51.403 --> 00:07:56.934
Now we are talking about curves. 
This curve has a curvature. 

95
00:07:56.934 --> 00:08:01.715
This curve has a curvature. 
You compute all of them. 

96
00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:05.340
There's one, 
which is the minimal, 

97
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.415
and one which is the maximal. Sometimes 
there's more than one. 

98
00:08:09.415 --> 00:08:13.757
For example a sphere might have, 
basically have more than one, all 

99
00:08:13.757 --> 00:08:17.899
directions are the same. 
But you have, for regular surfaces, you 

100
00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:22.976
have at least one which is the max and 
there which is the min, and those are 

101
00:08:22.976 --> 00:08:28.053
called the principal curvatures of the 
surface and I just tell you a bit of 

102
00:08:28.053 --> 00:08:33.397
extra information. The curve that gives 
you the max and the curve that gives you 

103
00:08:33.397 --> 00:08:38.509
the min are perpendicular to each other. 
Now, and there's way of computing this. 

104
00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:41.333
You don't really have to try all the 
curves. 

105
00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:45.249
There's way of computing. 
I'm just taking about concepts here. 

106
00:08:45.249 --> 00:08:49.165
So, there's one direction which is max. 
The other is min. 

107
00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:55.003
Think about the cylinder. 
When you cut a cylinder, perpendicular to 

108
00:08:55.003 --> 00:08:59.178
its axis, 
there is one direction that you basically 

109
00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:01.993
get a circle. 
What's a curvature there? 

110
00:09:01.993 --> 00:09:06.649
One over the radius, we know that. 
There's another direction in the 

111
00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:10.530
direction of the cylinder that you get a 
straight line. 

112
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.907
What's a curvature there, we know, it's 
zero. 

113
00:09:13.907 --> 00:09:17.600
So in one direction we get one over the 
radius. 

114
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.237
That's a maximum the other you get zero. 
That's a very nice thing. 

115
00:09:22.237 --> 00:09:25.060
it's a surface that in one of the 
directions, 

116
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.564
THE curvature is actually zero. 
So, on a curve, there is only one 

117
00:09:29.564 --> 00:09:32.853
curvature. 
You're turning, and there's only one 

118
00:09:32.853 --> 00:09:37.787
direction to go on the curve. 
On the surface, you can go in multiple 

119
00:09:37.787 --> 00:09:41.076
directions. 
And there will be one which is the 

120
00:09:41.076 --> 00:09:46.295
maximum direction that will curve the 
most, one is the minimal, where will 

121
00:09:46.295 --> 00:09:51.086
curve would curves the least. 
And actually, that basically completes 

122
00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:57.027
which is called the min curvature, which 
is the average of both of them, and the 

123
00:09:57.027 --> 00:10:00.903
Gaussian curvature which is the product 
of them. 

124
00:10:00.903 --> 00:10:04.536
So what's a Gaussian curvature of a 
cylinder? 

125
00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:07.519
Zero. 
At every point in one direction, 

126
00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:12.678
basically it's a straight line. 
So it's zero, and there is a lot of 

127
00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:18.240
beautiful differential geometry on 
surfaces, a lot of it due to Gauss. 

128
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.937
Really beautiful, but these are the basic 
concepts. So you have the same as on the 

129
00:10:23.937 --> 00:10:25.450
plane, 
curving, 

130
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.182
the curving of the surface, 
but we have curving in multiple 

131
00:10:29.182 --> 00:10:32.219
directions. 
We have the max, the min, and normally 

132
00:10:32.219 --> 00:10:37.281
people say, instead of taking the max and 
the min, let's take the average and the 

133
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:40.128
product. 
From this you can of course, from the 

134
00:10:40.128 --> 00:10:45.000
average and the product of course you can 
go back to the max and min, or vice 

135
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.595
versa. 
So these are basic concepts of surface 

136
00:10:48.595 --> 00:10:53.459
differential geometry. 
Again, we have normals, curvatures, the 

137
00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:57.746
same kind of concepts that we had for 
planar curves. 

138
00:10:57.746 --> 00:11:03.270
So now after these two videos, one 
relatively longer than the other. 

139
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.405
Your an expert in differential geometry. 
And at least you have the tools to 

140
00:11:08.405 --> 00:11:12.816
understand what is coming next. 
Which is deformation of curves, meaning 

141
00:11:12.816 --> 00:11:16.911
deformation of shapes, and their 
relationship of that with active 

142
00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:21.952
contours, active surfaces, and even with 
image denoising and image enhancement as 

143
00:11:21.952 --> 00:11:23.780
we are going to see it. 
Remember, 

144
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.694
images are surfaces, 
so we can treat them with the tools that 

145
00:11:27.694 --> 00:11:31.417
we, we just learned. 
They have curvatures, they have normals, 

146
00:11:31.417 --> 00:11:34.818
they have the same concepts of 
differential geometry. 

147
00:11:34.818 --> 00:11:39.054
I'll see you in the next video. 
This is getting real, really, really 

148
00:11:39.054 --> 00:11:41.236
exciting. 
I hope you're having fun. 

149
00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:43.033
See you very soon. 
Thank you.
