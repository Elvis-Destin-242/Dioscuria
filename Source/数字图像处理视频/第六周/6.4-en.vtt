00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.957
Hello and welcome back. 
Now we are going to be talking about 

2
00:00:03.957 --> 00:00:07.429
curve evolution. 
This is the concept that is going to 

3
00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:13.053
bring us to the understanding of active 
contours as we have seen in the previous 

4
00:00:13.053 --> 00:00:16.038
week. 
And as we have talked in the previous 

5
00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:18.954
videos as well. 
So what is curve evolution? 

6
00:00:18.954 --> 00:00:23.537
Very, very simple concept. 
The basic idea is that as we see here we 

7
00:00:23.537 --> 00:00:27.839
have a curve. 
And that every point we have a velocity 

8
00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:34.468
that defines how that curve is moving, 
and that's represented by this equation. 

9
00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:40.757
So it's a partial differential equation. 
If I'm going to write it in explicit 

10
00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:46.706
form, it's going to say the derivative of 
the curve, remember the curve is 

11
00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:52.660
parameterized by a parameter p. 
The derivative of the curve in time. 

12
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.730
So the curve is changing in time, is 
equal to certain velocity. 

13
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.740
And the velocity is again, at the given 
point. 

14
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.168
And the velocity might be changing in 
time. 

15
00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:13.067
So this is the complete equation. 
It's a partial differential equation and 

16
00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:19.126
we write in shorter form as here we know 
that, that the subscripts represent 

17
00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:23.352
derivatives. 
So at every point we're moving the curve. 

18
00:01:23.352 --> 00:01:27.099
So at some time we're going to have this 
curve. 

19
00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:32.915
A bit later we might have a curve. 
Like here, and then a bit later we might 

20
00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:38.893
have maybe a curve like this, depending 
on the velocity at every single point. 

21
00:01:38.893 --> 00:01:44.717
And as we're going to see, this type of 
deformations of curves, remember, curves 

22
00:01:44.717 --> 00:01:49.763
are boundaries of shapes. 
This type of deformations will bring us 

23
00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:54.646
some very, very interesting. 
Movements inside images and inside 

24
00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:58.309
videos. 
So let us see a few properties of this 

25
00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:03.723
and also a few examples that will 
illustrate the importance of this 

26
00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:07.905
concept. 
The first important property is the 

27
00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:12.319
following. 
We have a velocity at every point that's 

28
00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.731
a deformation velocity. 
Now that velocity can be decomposed of 

29
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:24.802
course, into the component that is normal 
to the curve, perpendicular to the curve. 

30
00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:31.611
We have defined normal as N tangents so 
we a vector we decompose it into it's 

31
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:37.659
normal and tangent components. 
It turns out that this tension component 

32
00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.678
does not change the shape of the curve, 
so it's not relevant. 

33
00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:47.697
So that's written here. 
This is the general equation that we 

34
00:02:47.697 --> 00:02:53.720
have, but we basically project the 
velocity towards the normal direction. 

35
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.530
And with a, only that projection and we 
move in the normal direction. 

36
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.194
So basically from the geometric point of 
view, the most general deformation is a 

37
00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:07.664
deformation in the normal direction to 
the curve. 

38
00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:11.275
You can add velocities in the tangential 
direction. 

39
00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:16.515
They just don't change the shape. 
Remember the tangent is the velocity you 

40
00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:20.763
are travelling the curve. 
So adding these terms, it's kind of 

41
00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:25.932
changing the velocity the things are 
moving but they're moving along the 

42
00:03:25.932 --> 00:03:29.190
curve. 
They are not really deforming the shape. 

43
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.100
Of the curves. 
So often we are going to just write curve 

44
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.789
evolution as deformations in the normal 
direction. 

45
00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:41.609
That's all what we care. 
Sometimes, for convenience, if you want, 

46
00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:47.629
you can add tangential components. 
You can add them as you wish to add them, 

47
00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.407
because they don't deform the curve. 
For example, if I have a motion like 

48
00:03:53.407 --> 00:03:57.970
this, CT. 
Equal some function in the tangent 

49
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.794
direction. 
So, no normal component. 

50
00:04:00.794 --> 00:04:04.647
These, does not change the shape of the 
curve at all. 

51
00:04:04.647 --> 00:04:10.204
Its only like, making a lot of effort, 
around the curve, but not changing the 

52
00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:14.205
curve at all. 
So the general, the formations are in the 

53
00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:18.503
normal direction. 
Lets just talk about more about that, and 

54
00:04:18.503 --> 00:04:23.393
lets just see a few examples. 
By the way, these properties, not very 

55
00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:28.580
hard to prove, and you can do that as an 
exercise, if you wish to do so. 

56
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.395
So, the first one that we want to talk is 
what's called curvature motion. 

57
00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:38.892
So, the deformation. 
In the normal direction is proportional 

58
00:04:38.892 --> 00:04:44.001
to the curvature at that point. 
Before I tell you what basically that 

59
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:49.111
type of deformation is doing to the 
curve, let's just look a bit more. 

60
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:52.740
Remember that the second derivative of 
the curve. 

61
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.243
When we take the derivative with respect 
to the Euclidian arc length is this. 

62
00:04:58.243 --> 00:05:03.890
So the second derivative of the curve, we 
know, is a vector perpendicular to the 

63
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.321
curve. 
And the magnitude of that vector is the 

64
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:10.752
curvature. 
So this deformation, is like the first 

65
00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:15.541
derivative in time equal second 
derivative according to arc length. 

66
00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:20.902
For those that are familiar a bit more 
with differential equations, this is 

67
00:05:20.902 --> 00:05:24.328
like. 
What's called the heat flow based very 

68
00:05:24.328 --> 00:05:30.230
geometric because of this arc length. 
So in explicit form, this says that dC. 

69
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.580
Dt is equal to the second derivative of 
C. 

70
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.408
According to the arc length. 
Okay? 

71
00:05:39.408 --> 00:05:44.293
it's a very interesting. 
Deformation of curves. 

72
00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:49.552
And what it does, it basically first of 
all, is Euclidean invariant. 

73
00:05:49.552 --> 00:05:55.369
Curvature is Euclidean invariant, meaning 
it's invariant to rotations and 

74
00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:59.831
translations and the normal is also 
Euclidean invariant. 

75
00:05:59.831 --> 00:06:05.410
So if you do a rotation and translation 
or an Euclidean transform and. 

76
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.681
First you do the deformation and you do 
the deformation here. 

77
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:12.972
Also here. 
Along the way of the deformation, the 

78
00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:17.454
curves are related by exactly the same 
rotation and translation. 

79
00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:20.885
So you start from two, from a curve, you 
rotate it. 

80
00:06:20.885 --> 00:06:24.526
You start the form in both, according to 
this motion. 

81
00:06:24.526 --> 00:06:29.918
And any time you stop, the same rotation 
and translation relates the deformed 

82
00:06:29.918 --> 00:06:32.860
curve. 
That will happen as long as you use. 

83
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.232
Properties which are invariant to 
rotation and translation. 

84
00:06:37.232 --> 00:06:41.530
Now this motion does some very beautiful 
things to curves. 

85
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.425
And the basic idea. 
And this has been proven, a number of 

86
00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:50.104
times. 
But was first proved by Grayson some time 

87
00:06:50.104 --> 00:06:52.250
ago. 
Then you take any curve. 

88
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.235
Think about any curve that is not self 
intersecting. 

89
00:06:56.235 --> 00:07:01.753
So that's called a simple curve. 
That's actually the boundary of a shape. 

90
00:07:01.753 --> 00:07:07.425
You take any cure, you deform with these. 
And the curve becomes convex. 

91
00:07:07.425 --> 00:07:11.870
It just opens up. 
It just gets very smoothly into a convex 

92
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.453
shape. 
Once it convex, if you keep going, starts 

93
00:07:15.453 --> 00:07:19.358
rounding. 
And basically, it ends in what's called a 

94
00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:23.419
round point. 
So it actually will vanish, it will keep 

95
00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:26.220
shrinking. 
Basically we keep going inside 

96
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.521
proportional to the curvature. 
And at the end, it would look like a 

97
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:33.454
round point. 
So if you dilate it all the time. 

98
00:07:33.454 --> 00:07:38.342
If you just make the area constant all 
the time, you will see this becoming 

99
00:07:38.342 --> 00:07:41.861
round and round. 
So what you see is that no matter how 

100
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:46.750
crazy and how difficult your shape is. 
As long as it doesn't self-intersect. 

101
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:52.203
And basically, it just opens up, so it's 
becoming smoother and smoother, until it 

102
00:07:52.203 --> 00:07:55.654
becomes a circle. 
Remember, the circle has constant 

103
00:07:55.654 --> 00:07:59.036
curvature. 
So this is basically going from a very 

104
00:07:59.036 --> 00:08:02.694
crazy curve. 
It might be a curve that does a lot like 

105
00:08:02.694 --> 00:08:07.350
this. 
As much as you want, and then smoothly. 

106
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:12.472
Is becoming, just nicer, so it's 
actualizing regularizing the curve. 

107
00:08:12.472 --> 00:08:15.965
And if you wait all the way, it becomes 
round. 

108
00:08:15.965 --> 00:08:19.879
Constant curvature. 
If you remember, the heat flow takes 

109
00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:25.231
heat, no matter the distribution of the 
heat, at the end becomes constant in the 

110
00:08:25.231 --> 00:08:28.347
room. 
This, no matter what the curvature is all 

111
00:08:28.347 --> 00:08:33.022
around, at the end it becomes constant. 
It becomes one over the radius. 

112
00:08:33.022 --> 00:08:37.968
How much it takes it to get to here? 
We're going to know that in a couple of 

113
00:08:37.968 --> 00:08:40.813
minutes. 
Don't worry, this is a very simple 

114
00:08:40.813 --> 00:08:46.098
property to prove how long it takes for 
the curve to completely collapse into 

115
00:08:46.098 --> 00:08:50.247
this round point. 
Before we do that, let's do a couple of 

116
00:08:50.247 --> 00:08:54.243
additional examples. 
Now that was the Euclidean case. 

117
00:08:54.243 --> 00:08:58.854
What about the fine case? 
The fine case turns out to be this 

118
00:08:58.854 --> 00:09:02.005
function. 
This is the Euclidean curvature. 

119
00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:06.693
Where do we get it from? 
We are going to do, let me just write it 

120
00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:10.767
here for a second. 
We are going to do the same as we did 

121
00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:11.920
before. 
But now. 

122
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.964
According to the affine arc length. 
Now remember when you take second 

123
00:09:16.964 --> 00:09:22.082
derivative according to the affine arc 
length, you are not necessarily 

124
00:09:22.082 --> 00:09:26.846
perpendicular to your curve. 
But, we know that the tangential 

125
00:09:26.846 --> 00:09:31.261
component does not matter. 
So you have to project it. 

126
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:37.968
And we already saw before, in one of the 
previous videos, that the projection of 

127
00:09:37.968 --> 00:09:44.420
the fine normal, the second derivative, 
into the Euclidean normal, is kappa to 

128
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.495
the one third. 
Is the curvature to the one third. 

129
00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:51.302
So. 
These two equations, are from the 

130
00:09:51.302 --> 00:09:56.949
geometric point of view, equivalent. 
They are absolutely the same equation. 

131
00:09:56.949 --> 00:10:02.750
But these has motion in the tangent 
direction, that is not relevant, so once 

132
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:08.088
we project it, to the normal direction, 
we get this beautiful equation. 

133
00:10:08.088 --> 00:10:14.199
Looks like a Uclidian, that has a magic 
exponent, that makes it a fine invariant, 

134
00:10:14.199 --> 00:10:18.809
that means. 
That if I take a shape and I do an affine 

135
00:10:18.809 --> 00:10:25.654
transform of that shape and now I evolve. 
Both of them, then all the time I can 

136
00:10:25.654 --> 00:10:29.858
relate them by exactly the same a fine 
transform. 

137
00:10:29.858 --> 00:10:35.520
So this is a fine invariant. 
So I can be doing smoothing in a fine 

138
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:42.384
regularization cleaning my curve in a 
fine variant fashion meaning invariant to 

139
00:10:42.384 --> 00:10:46.917
tilts of the camera. 
When we are under the assumptions that 

140
00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:50.817
the fine model is a good model, as we 
discussed before. 

141
00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:55.295
And now, you can also prove a number of 
interesting properties. 

142
00:10:55.295 --> 00:11:00.929
Similarly to the Euclidian case, what 
happens here is that the curve, no matter 

143
00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:05.808
how crazy it is, it becomes. 
Convex again and then it goes into an 

144
00:11:05.808 --> 00:11:08.583
ellipse. 
It doesn't go into a circle. 

145
00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:13.592
We are in a fine domain. 
Circles and ellipses are the same in the 

146
00:11:13.592 --> 00:11:19.450
fine domain because a, a circle within a 
fine transform goes into an ellipse. 

147
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.715
Moreover, the lips has constant. 
Affine curvature. 

148
00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:28.406
Remember this mu that we discussed. 
That is the affine curvature. 

149
00:11:28.406 --> 00:11:33.975
So as in the Euclidean case, we start 
from something that might have a crazy 

150
00:11:33.975 --> 00:11:37.786
affine curvature. 
Slowly, the, this crazy or this very 

151
00:11:37.786 --> 00:11:42.770
change in the affine curvature is 
deforming towards constant affine 

152
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.507
curvature. 
And that's why this is called the affine 

153
00:11:46.507 --> 00:11:50.098
heat flow. 
It's taking curvature that is very non 

154
00:11:50.098 --> 00:11:53.470
uniform and it's making it uniform at the 
end. 

155
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.358
So that's another very interesting 
motion. 

156
00:11:56.358 --> 00:12:01.172
They're clearly an undefined. 
They're both kind of cleaning the curves, 

157
00:12:01.172 --> 00:12:05.230
meaning, cleaning the shapes. 
Now, not every motion does that. 

158
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:11.262
If we take the simplest of the motions, 
constant speed in the normal direction, 

159
00:12:11.262 --> 00:12:16.598
just at every point, move a step. 
I don't care the curvature, about the 

160
00:12:16.598 --> 00:12:21.470
curvature of my curve. 
I just move a step at every single point. 

161
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.126
Now. 
This is a very important equation. 

162
00:12:24.126 --> 00:12:29.717
It's the question that creates offsets. 
You're creating a curve which is parallel 

163
00:12:29.717 --> 00:12:34.065
to the previous curve. 
You can move inwards or you can do minus 

164
00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:38.482
here and move outwards. 
So you're creating another curve that is 

165
00:12:38.482 --> 00:12:41.450
parallel. 
It is equal distance all the time. 

166
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:46.981
And basically if you keep going you get 
another equal distance and then you get 

167
00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:51.337
another equal distance here and so on 
depending how far you go. 

168
00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:54.725
Remember this is a differential equation 
in time. 

169
00:12:54.725 --> 00:12:59.979
You can stop or you can keep going. 
Now this curve is obtained by doing this 

170
00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:03.990
deformation, but is also obtained in the 
following fashion. 

171
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:09.213
You, draw a circle centered on the curve 
and with a given radius. 

172
00:13:09.213 --> 00:13:15.089
And then for every point you draw a 
circle with exactly the same radius. 

173
00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:20.610
And then you take the envelope. 
Of that circle and that gives you this. 

174
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.423
Constant motion deformation. 
And that's related to what's called 

175
00:13:25.423 --> 00:13:30.037
Huygens principle in physics. 
That's how waves propagate, basically 

176
00:13:30.037 --> 00:13:34.453
when they don't have obstructions. 
So, if you had, maybe you did this 

177
00:13:34.453 --> 00:13:39.661
experiment in physics, where you where 
you basically propagate waves and that's 

178
00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:43.681
what this constant motion does for the 
Huygens principal. 

179
00:13:43.681 --> 00:13:46.780
So maybe you knew that the... 
So this is a wave. 

180
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:51.660
And maybe you knew the Huggins principle 
basically is the one that governs the 

181
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.440
motion of the waves without any 
obstructions. 

182
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.270
So that's just nothing else than this 
type of curve evolution. 

183
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:03.702
So, this kind of revolution is important 
in image processing, but it also explains 

184
00:14:03.702 --> 00:14:06.720
a lot of very interesting physical 
phenomena. 

185
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.544
Constant motion. 
Now this constant motion is very 

186
00:14:10.544 --> 00:14:14.525
interesting. 
For example, it can actually change the 

187
00:14:14.525 --> 00:14:18.350
topology of a curve. 
If you start from this curve. 

188
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:24.813
And then you move with constant velocity, 
after awhile the curve splits in two. 

189
00:14:24.813 --> 00:14:31.029
This cannot happen in the curvature 
motion for Euclidean or affine that we 

190
00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:34.344
saw. 
The curve stays simple, stays smooth. 

191
00:14:34.344 --> 00:14:40.476
Here actually it can split into pieces, 
it's like the waves can split into 

192
00:14:40.476 --> 00:14:44.371
pieces. 
There are even more things happening, if 

193
00:14:44.371 --> 00:14:50.669
you start with a smooth curve and you 
move inwards after awhile these sides 

194
00:14:50.669 --> 00:14:54.546
will collapse. 
They don't have a curvature term here so 

195
00:14:54.546 --> 00:14:59.781
they don't have any way to understand 
that the curvature is becoming very, very 

196
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:01.438
high. 
It's going to collapse. 

197
00:15:01.438 --> 00:15:05.215
It's going to get to a corner. 
Corner has infinite curvature. 

198
00:15:05.215 --> 00:15:09.992
Just you, really turn very fast. 
That's a no, because there is no 

199
00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:14.841
curvature term here. 
So after some time it will basically 

200
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:19.180
collapse and it will create what are 
called shocks. 

201
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.775
And we know that from waves. 
When waves are coming, they can collapse. 

202
00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:28.370
And they can create these shocks. 
This doesn't happen with curvature 

203
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:33.438
motions for the fine or Euclidean case. 
The curve stays smooth all the time. 

204
00:15:33.438 --> 00:15:37.696
It will never collapse. 
The constant flow creates this collapse. 

205
00:15:37.696 --> 00:15:42.224
So we have the both extremes. 
The constant flow can change topology. 

206
00:15:42.224 --> 00:15:44.859
Can collapse things. 
Can create corners. 

207
00:15:44.859 --> 00:15:48.061
Now. 
The curvature regularizes discrete 

208
00:15:48.061 --> 00:15:54.844
corners so maybe it sharpens shapes, so 
we have both motions depending on what we 

209
00:15:54.844 --> 00:16:00.790
want to do in the image processing arena. 
Now once we have this type of. 

210
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.925
Curvature motions. 
And I'm basically going to write them 

211
00:16:04.925 --> 00:16:09.451
here again, so you remember them. 
We have the constant flow. 

212
00:16:09.451 --> 00:16:15.226
No speed here, or speed equal one. 
The curvature flow Euclidan, and the fine 

213
00:16:15.226 --> 00:16:18.815
flow. 
The constant motion can split curves, can 

214
00:16:18.815 --> 00:16:21.110
do. 
Can do shocks, can do corners. 

215
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:27.434
That gradient one regularizes everything 
into a circle and affine regularizes 

216
00:16:27.434 --> 00:16:30.347
everything into an ellipse. 
Which ellipse? 

217
00:16:30.347 --> 00:16:34.540
We don't know, we have fine space. 
All ellipses are the same. 

218
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:39.848
Now, we can write a lot of properties of 
these deformation, and those are just 

219
00:16:39.848 --> 00:16:44.951
interesting curiosity, sometimes, they 
are very useful for image processing, 

220
00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:50.053
sometimes, they are just nice things, one 
of the things, we are going to see is, 

221
00:16:50.053 --> 00:16:55.155
when does these curve in the Uchlion case 
collapses, and this is just some 

222
00:16:55.155 --> 00:17:00.464
calculus, so its not very hard to do. 
But if you take a certain deformation, so 

223
00:17:00.464 --> 00:17:05.842
remember we only consider the normal 
deformation, and with velocity with speed 

224
00:17:05.842 --> 00:17:08.297
V. 
So for example how is the length 

225
00:17:08.297 --> 00:17:13.425
changing, and deforming the curve. 
What's happening to the length of curve? 

226
00:17:13.425 --> 00:17:16.797
So we have to take the derivative of the 
length. 

227
00:17:16.797 --> 00:17:20.283
And this is. 
The definition of the length of curve, so 

228
00:17:20.283 --> 00:17:25.376
it's the interval all around the curve. 
That's the symbol with the circle there 

229
00:17:25.376 --> 00:17:30.082
as you go all around the curve, we're 
talking about closed curves, in this 

230
00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:32.983
case. 
So you go all around the curve and this 

231
00:17:32.983 --> 00:17:38.140
is the function of basically the length. 
Now I have to put the derivative inside 

232
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:43.040
and we have already seen that we take the 
derivative of the first component. 

233
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.909
* the second + the second * the first. 
These are symmetric. 

234
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:52.608
So that's why we get these two here and 
then we get here and we're going to have 

235
00:17:52.608 --> 00:17:58.377
to reverse the order here of derivatives. 
And instead of c derivative with respect 

236
00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:01.472
to p and then t, we're going to reverse 
that. 

237
00:18:01.472 --> 00:18:06.116
So it's a bit of calculus and we get at 
the end these expressions. 

238
00:18:06.116 --> 00:18:10.337
So this is the expression that governs 
the change of length. 

239
00:18:10.337 --> 00:18:14.840
And we're going to see an example in a 
second for different v's. 

240
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.161
We can do the same for area. 
We basically, instead of inner product, 

241
00:18:19.161 --> 00:18:22.107
we take the outer product or the 
determinant. 

242
00:18:22.107 --> 00:18:26.036
We have already seen that. 
We take basically the two vectors. 

243
00:18:26.036 --> 00:18:28.851
And we take the determinant of that 
matrix. 

244
00:18:28.851 --> 00:18:32.583
And that computes area. 
We can also look at the change of 

245
00:18:32.583 --> 00:18:35.726
basically curvature. 
And these are the questions. 

246
00:18:35.726 --> 00:18:40.047
Again, I don't want to take too much time 
to do the whole derivation. 

247
00:18:40.047 --> 00:18:41.750
They're not very hard. 
And. 

248
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:48.015
They appear in the book, for example, 
that, that I mentioned, but here we have 

249
00:18:48.015 --> 00:18:51.183
the. 
General formulas of the change of length, 

250
00:18:51.183 --> 00:18:54.984
area and curvature. 
This is actually a very interesting 

251
00:18:54.984 --> 00:18:57.886
formula. 
It's basically, in some cases, it's 

252
00:18:57.886 --> 00:19:03.000
called a reaction diffusion equation. 
It's the same type of equations that 

253
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.906
people use to model how, basically, 
patterns in the skin, patterns in the 

254
00:19:07.906 --> 00:19:11.361
zebra are created. 
It has kind of a diffusion term. 

255
00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:15.508
And it has kind of a shock term here for 
certain types of V. 

256
00:19:15.508 --> 00:19:20.760
So let's just pick some examples and see 
what happens for different V's, for. 

257
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.566
Example for V equal one, the constant 
motion. 

258
00:19:24.566 --> 00:19:31.227
So for the constant motion we have V 
equal one, and then the change of length 

259
00:19:31.227 --> 00:19:36.936
we put here, V equal one. 
So it's the integral all around the curve 

260
00:19:36.936 --> 00:19:38.580
from zero to L. 
Now. 

261
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:44.575
There is integral of the curvature around 
a closed curve, it's always equal to two 

262
00:19:44.575 --> 00:19:49.036
Pi, that's basic fundamental theorem in 
differential geometry. 

263
00:19:49.036 --> 00:19:54.081
And that basically says that the length 
is changing at constant rate. 

264
00:19:54.081 --> 00:19:59.858
The length is changing so the derivative 
of the length is changing at constant 

265
00:19:59.858 --> 00:20:01.543
length. 
And that, if you. 

266
00:20:01.543 --> 00:20:05.722
Integrate that, it tells you. 
When, are you starting to see. 

267
00:20:05.722 --> 00:20:09.681
Crazy things happening, as we're going to 
see in a second. 

268
00:20:09.681 --> 00:20:11.954
So, the time. 
That things change. 

269
00:20:11.954 --> 00:20:16.060
So you can either. 
Write it as a function of the, initial 

270
00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.580
length or as a function of time. 
You get it here. 

271
00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:25.205
The are is basically, this was the 
general formula, that V=1, and basically 

272
00:20:25.205 --> 00:20:29.325
we have the integral from zero to L of 
one, that's L. 

273
00:20:29.325 --> 00:20:33.366
So, the area is changing proportional to 
the length. 

274
00:20:33.366 --> 00:20:37.406
Now, the length is changing. 
So, this is not constant. 

275
00:20:37.406 --> 00:20:43.666
This is constant, this is not constant. 
The area is changing, proportional to the 

276
00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:45.330
length. 
The curvature. 

277
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:50.718
This was the general formula. 
And we have the, then the derivative is 

278
00:20:50.718 --> 00:20:54.284
equal to the curvature^2. 
Because V is constant. 

279
00:20:54.284 --> 00:20:59.435
So second derivative vanishes. 
Now you can solve this equation of 

280
00:20:59.435 --> 00:21:04.032
derivative of curvature according to time 
equal curvature^2. 

281
00:21:04.032 --> 00:21:09.262
You solve it, and you get this equation. 
And look what happens here. 

282
00:21:09.262 --> 00:21:13.700
This, basically, the curvature blocks. 
It becomes infinity. 

283
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:18.278
When t is one over the curvature at the 
original curve. 

284
00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:22.107
Remember, we say that things can create 
shocks. 

285
00:21:22.107 --> 00:21:26.602
Basically, the waves are coming, and 
boom, they collapse. 

286
00:21:26.602 --> 00:21:31.597
And that's basically very high curvature, 
infinite curvature. 

287
00:21:31.597 --> 00:21:35.010
When that happens, when this term is 
zero. 

288
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:39.514
When is that happening? 
When t is one over the initial curvature 

289
00:21:39.514 --> 00:21:42.802
at this point. 
One over curvature is radius. 

290
00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:47.644
So you know exactly when are you 
expecting a shock to happen. 

291
00:21:47.644 --> 00:21:52.646
When are you expecting these waves from 
both sides to collapse? 

292
00:21:52.646 --> 00:21:55.901
You go around your initial, initial 
curve. 

293
00:21:55.901 --> 00:21:59.950
And you say, where do I have, basically, 
my curvature? 

294
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.664
Of this form. 
When is that going to happen? 

295
00:22:02.664 --> 00:22:07.814
When is this curvature going to become 
infinity, because it's collapsing from 

296
00:22:07.814 --> 00:22:10.946
both sides. 
Oh, at time one over the curvature. 

297
00:22:10.946 --> 00:22:15.748
The larger the curvature, the shorter the 
time it will become a shock. 

298
00:22:15.748 --> 00:22:21.525
So if you have something which is already 
almost, almost a corner very fast, it 

299
00:22:21.525 --> 00:22:25.631
will become a shock. 
So from these equations, you understand 

300
00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:27.956
the. 
Overall behavior of that. 

301
00:22:27.956 --> 00:22:34.589
You can, of course, do that also for the 
curvature flow for the Euclidean case and 

302
00:22:34.589 --> 00:22:39.420
once again you plug in the same equations 
and in this case. 

303
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:44.826
This is the general formula of the area. 
Now, the velocity now is curvature. 

304
00:22:44.826 --> 00:22:49.575
So you integrate, again, the integral of 
the curvature is constant. 

305
00:22:49.575 --> 00:22:55.420
So you get that in the constant motion, 
the length was changing at constant rate. 

306
00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:01.496
In the Uclindian motion, the area in the 
Uclidian curvature motion, the area is 

307
00:23:01.496 --> 00:23:06.222
changing at constant rate. 
And then, I can solve for these, and I 

308
00:23:06.222 --> 00:23:11.924
can tell youi exactly, when is the curve 
collapsing, It is collapsing at time, 

309
00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:15.450
which is the initial area, divided by two 
party. 

310
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:21.207
So you look at your initial area, you 
divide by two pi and say, at this time my 

311
00:23:21.207 --> 00:23:25.120
whole curve will become a point. 
Remember this motion. 

312
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:30.192
Collapses everything to a point that all 
the way smooth in contrast with a 

313
00:23:30.192 --> 00:23:33.033
constant motion. 
Here everything is smooth. 

314
00:23:33.033 --> 00:23:37.362
It just gets cleaner and cleaner and it 
goes into a round point. 

315
00:23:37.362 --> 00:23:41.555
At when exactly at this time. 
So that's why these formulas are 

316
00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:46.898
important to understand how the length is 
changing, how the area is changing, or 

317
00:23:46.898 --> 00:23:51.904
even hos the curvature is changing. 
So these are really, really interesting 

318
00:23:51.904 --> 00:23:55.421
properties. 
We can do the same for the fine case, and 

319
00:23:55.421 --> 00:23:58.600
you get this formulas, there is no kind 
of, very. 

320
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.966
Clean way to solve this type of 
integrals. 

321
00:24:01.966 --> 00:24:07.899
So you just get these formulas. 
There's no constant basically things 

322
00:24:07.899 --> 00:24:13.510
here, although you can make an 
interpretation of some of the things as 

323
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:18.561
constants but let's just not discuss 
about that in this moment. 

324
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:22.489
So basically we have properties of these 
motions. 

325
00:24:22.489 --> 00:24:25.177
Now. 
One of the motions, so these are 

326
00:24:25.177 --> 00:24:30.283
curvature motions, constant motions. 
The active contours we talk about 

327
00:24:30.283 --> 00:24:34.870
basically are these type of deformations. 
Nothing else in that. 

328
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:40.863
And then I'll just give you one example 
of active contour's velocity and when we 

329
00:24:40.863 --> 00:24:46.635
learn in one of the next videos, calculus 
of variations, after that we're going to 

330
00:24:46.635 --> 00:24:52.480
be able to derive this motion in a more 
formal way, but even now I can write it 

331
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.440
down and explain it to you. 
So this is V. 

332
00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.296
What we have here is b. 
So this equation looks very long, but 

333
00:25:00.296 --> 00:25:05.946
it's nothing else than a deformation with 
a certain velocity in the normal 

334
00:25:05.946 --> 00:25:09.335
direction. 
Now what are the terms inside here? 

335
00:25:09.335 --> 00:25:13.025
So this curve. 
Is basically going to deform with a 

336
00:25:13.025 --> 00:25:16.380
certain velocity. 
Now what are these terms? 

337
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.936
Here's the curvature. 
No problem. 

338
00:25:18.936 --> 00:25:21.253
We know it. 
Here's the normal. 

339
00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:23.410
Here's the normal. 
What's g? 

340
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:28.583
G is, for example, is a function that 
depends on the image, and, for example, 

341
00:25:28.583 --> 00:25:33.401
one over the gradient of the image. 
Now, why do we need this function? 

342
00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:36.378
Let's say that this function was not 
here. 

343
00:25:36.378 --> 00:25:39.637
Let's just leave aside this term for a 
second. 

344
00:25:39.637 --> 00:25:45.094
Let's assume that this function was never 
here, so we have city equal K, kappa, 

345
00:25:45.094 --> 00:25:48.566
curvature, collapses to a point. 
I don't want that. 

346
00:25:48.566 --> 00:25:54.416
I want this red curve here. 
Basically, to stop, basically, add the 

347
00:25:54.416 --> 00:26:01.414
boundaries of the shapes. 
I don't want it to collapse to a point. 

348
00:26:01.414 --> 00:26:07.210
So how do I do that? 
I make it stop at high gradients. 

349
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:13.990
So if g is proportional to one over the 
gradient of the image. 

350
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:17.699
Then, let's say that I have a very strong 
boundary. 

351
00:26:17.699 --> 00:26:21.630
The gradient is very high. 
Let's assume it's infinity. 

352
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.859
And then G is zero. 
So the curvature's trying to collapse, 

353
00:26:25.859 --> 00:26:31.571
collapse, but it gets multiplied by zero 
and then stops, say, hey, I cannot move 

354
00:26:31.571 --> 00:26:33.351
any more. 
I need to stop. 

355
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:38.173
There is no more velocity. 
And that's why you have this term here. 

356
00:26:38.173 --> 00:26:40.720
Now. 
We never have ideal shapes. 

357
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:46.136
So this derivative of G. 
Remember, G is one over derivative of the 

358
00:26:46.136 --> 00:26:49.803
image. 
For example, the gradient, or any other 

359
00:26:49.803 --> 00:26:54.470
type of function. 
You take another derivative of that to 

360
00:26:54.470 --> 00:27:00.720
make that stopping term even stronger, 
even when there are no perfect edges. 

361
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.916
That this will not be zero. 
You basically create that potential 

362
00:27:04.916 --> 00:27:10.245
valley by taking the second derivative, 
and of course that doesn't have to be in 

363
00:27:10.245 --> 00:27:14.042
the normal direction, so you have to 
project without that. 

364
00:27:14.042 --> 00:27:19.038
Every time we have something that's not 
in the normal direction, we have to 

365
00:27:19.038 --> 00:27:23.767
project it to the normal direction. 
So this is almost nothing else than 

366
00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:27.860
curvature motion. 
So, a simplified version of active 

367
00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.400
counters is this. 
Its curvature motion. 

368
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:37.562
In the normal direction multiplied by G. 
G is a function of your image, it's the 

369
00:27:37.562 --> 00:27:43.958
one that tells stop when you get to very 
high gradients and this second term just 

370
00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:49.652
made that stopping even stronger. 
So here it is, we saw active counters in 

371
00:27:49.652 --> 00:27:55.814
the previous week and now we have been 
talking about differential geometry and 

372
00:27:55.814 --> 00:28:00.780
we have been talking about. 
Curvature, curve motions and how things 

373
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:06.646
deform, why, one of the reasons is to get 
to active counters, you're an expert now 

374
00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:10.240
in differential geometry, you're an 
expert now in. 

375
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.520
Curve evolution, curve the formation. 
So here it is. 

376
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.048
You could have to sign this. 
If I give you five minutes to say, define 

377
00:28:18.048 --> 00:28:22.641
this sign of curve evolution motion that 
will get you active contours. 

378
00:28:22.641 --> 00:28:27.102
Many of you, most of you probably would 
have come with this solution. 

379
00:28:27.102 --> 00:28:30.318
Just deform it smoothly, move towards the 
objects. 

380
00:28:30.318 --> 00:28:35.435
But when you get to the objects, stop. 
And then people have done many different 

381
00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:39.044
variations of these. 
But this is the underlying concept. 

382
00:28:39.044 --> 00:28:43.827
You can add some constant motion. 
That helps you to move faster, but be 

383
00:28:43.827 --> 00:28:48.072
very careful you can get shocks and you 
can you keep moving. 

384
00:28:48.072 --> 00:28:53.520
So always you have to have turns that 
depend on the image, not just depend on 

385
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.128
the curve, depend on the image. 
So it makes you stop. 

386
00:28:57.128 --> 00:29:02.487
And you can basically go wide and do 
very, very interesting things in Curve 

387
00:29:02.487 --> 00:29:08.616
evolution to get to active contours. 
Now remember, we know how to define these 

388
00:29:08.616 --> 00:29:14.188
properties also for surfaces. 
So we could do that for surfaces as well 

389
00:29:14.188 --> 00:29:18.247
and basically, here is just an example of 
a surface. 

390
00:29:18.247 --> 00:29:23.740
So these are snapshots of a surface that 
started basically from here. 

391
00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:28.055
And it deform, it deform, it deform and 
it is covered inside. 

392
00:29:28.055 --> 00:29:32.443
They were basically two rings basically 
touching each other. 

393
00:29:32.443 --> 00:29:38.295
And this motion is nothing else than the 
motion I just wrote for you but now in 

394
00:29:38.295 --> 00:29:43.561
surface domain and here, this was an 
ideal object, white and black, so the 

395
00:29:43.561 --> 00:29:48.827
gradient was very strong and one of the, 
over the gradient was very weak. 

396
00:29:48.827 --> 00:29:55.371
So basically when I did the surface 
evolution, dS, dt equal let's say, one of 

397
00:29:55.371 --> 00:30:00.240
the curvatures and, can be the Gaussian, 
can be the mean. 

398
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.023
Yeah we could discuss more about that, 
what curvature exactly to put here. 

399
00:30:05.023 --> 00:30:09.544
The normal direction, that would 
basically move, move, move and then we 

400
00:30:09.544 --> 00:30:14.327
have G, that basically you say, we'll 
say, when you get to a very, very high 

401
00:30:14.327 --> 00:30:17.669
gradients, stop. 
And so this is just a ve, artificial 

402
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:20.355
example. 
We're going to see more examples of 

403
00:30:20.355 --> 00:30:25.663
active contours later on now that we're 
becoming experts in this curve evolution 

404
00:30:25.663 --> 00:30:30.249
and differential geometry and this is 
just, as I say, snapshots of this 

405
00:30:30.249 --> 00:30:33.656
evolution. 
So a lot of very interesting mathematical 

406
00:30:33.656 --> 00:30:36.934
tools. 
That give us, active counters, which is 

407
00:30:36.934 --> 00:30:42.931
one of the most useful techniques for 
doing image segmentation, as we have seen 

408
00:30:42.931 --> 00:30:48.700
many examples last week and as we're 
going to keep looking at more examples. 

409
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:53.662
So now we're experts on curve evolution. 
And I'm looking forward to seeing you in 

410
00:30:53.662 --> 00:30:58.441
the next video when we're going to keep 
learning, keep building the tools that 

411
00:30:58.441 --> 00:31:03.280
will let us understand everything about 
these active counters and this type of 

412
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.956
deformation as well as some of the 
material coming later on. 

413
00:31:06.956 --> 00:31:10.020
Thank you very much and see you in the 
next video.
