00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.181
Hello, and welcome back. 
I want to give you an example of a very 

2
00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:09.255
particular and important application of 
partial differential equations and 

3
00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:12.382
variation of formulations in image 
processing. 

4
00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:17.512
And this will put together, some of the 
concepts that we have just learned, in a 

5
00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:21.275
very, very simple fashion. 
So, what we are going to do is we're 

6
00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:25.587
going to do histogram modification with 
partial differential equations. 

7
00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:30.367
We know how to do histogram modification. 
We have learned that a few weeks ago. 

8
00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:34.871
Now I'm going to show you how to do that 
with partial differential equations. 

9
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:39.747
The basic idea is, as we always do with 
partial differential equations. 

10
00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:43.277
We want to deform the image towards a 
certain goal. 

11
00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:46.807
In particular now, we want to change the 
contrast. 

12
00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:52.272
We want to deform the image in such a way 
that improves the contrast, and we can 

13
00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:57.532
start thinking about how to do that if we 
understand partial differential 

14
00:00:57.532 --> 00:01:01.086
equations. 
We want to stretch the grey values of the 

15
00:01:01.086 --> 00:01:03.521
image. 
Now, how we are going to do that? 

16
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:08.213
In this particular case, we're going back 
into histogram modification. 

17
00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:10.792
We know how to do that. 
We learned that. 

18
00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:14.238
It's just a simple map that we learned a 
few weeks ago. 

19
00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:18.573
So here is how you do it with a partial 
differential equation, as an 

20
00:01:18.573 --> 00:01:22.485
illustration. 
Here is the partial differential 

21
00:01:22.485 --> 00:01:26.077
equation. 
You're going to deform the image, 

22
00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:32.392
according to its own pixel value at the 
given pixel, minus the number of pixels 

23
00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:36.812
that are great than u. 
So, you have an image, 

24
00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:42.361
you're sitting at a certain pixel, and 
say How am I going to change these 

25
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:46.705
pixels? Very simple. 
You look at your own value, you look at 

26
00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:52.476
how many values are above you, and you 
deform yourself according to that, to the 

27
00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:56.770
difference between both of them. 
Now why is this doing the histogram 

28
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.742
modification? Very simple. Remember what 
we talked. 

29
00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:09.865
Normally you deform the image equal to 
your goal. Now, when you get to steady 

30
00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:18.920
state, these becomes 0. So the image 
becomes equal the pixel value at, of the 

31
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.755
image, becomes equal to the number of 
pixel values, above your own value. 

32
00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:30.772
And this is exactly, if you go back to 
your notes on histogram modification, 

33
00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:36.946
this is exactly histogram equalization. 
So this is a very interesting way to 

34
00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:42.805
achieve histogram equalization. 
Instead of doing a look-up table, as we 

35
00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:46.776
learned, we just slowly deform the image 
towards it. 

36
00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:52.468
Now, you may ask yourself, why do I have 
to implement a partial differential 

37
00:02:52.468 --> 00:02:58.287
equation that is computationally more 
expensive than just doing that look-up 

38
00:02:58.287 --> 00:03:03.979
table? There's a couple of reasons. 
One, pedagogically, I'm giving you these 

39
00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:09.726
as an example of a partial differential 
equation acheiving something that, we 

40
00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:14.924
want to achieve like, exactly the 
condition for histogram equalization. 

41
00:03:14.924 --> 00:03:19.985
Now, there is another reason. 
You might stop, this deformation, at any 

42
00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:23.531
moment. 
In histogram equalization, you do the 

43
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.601
math. 
There is no intermediate solution. 

44
00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:30.591
If that was too much contrast, then 
you're in trouble. 

45
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:33.843
There is no way, either, no way back 
either. 

46
00:03:33.843 --> 00:03:38.514
The original image, or that. 
Here you can start stretching your 

47
00:03:38.514 --> 00:03:41.698
histogram. 
Start moving towards histogram 

48
00:03:41.698 --> 00:03:45.722
equalization. 
But you can stop before you finish that, 

49
00:03:45.722 --> 00:03:48.797
if you are already satisfied with the 
result. 

50
00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:53.272
Or even if that result is better than 
going all the way to histogram 

51
00:03:53.272 --> 00:03:56.822
equalization. 
So those are examples of why you might 

52
00:03:56.822 --> 00:04:01.397
want to do a partial differential 
equation instead of a lookup table. 

53
00:04:01.397 --> 00:04:05.761
Now, of course. 
In the same way that you can do partial ? 

54
00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:11.828
equations you can try to do this contrast 
enhancement by solving a variational 

55
00:04:11.828 --> 00:04:14.949
problem. 
And here is an example of such a 

56
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:19.512
variational problem. 
Again the art here is for you to start 

57
00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:25.631
putting terms in the variational problem 
that will help you to achieve your goal. 

58
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:30.605
So here is one term. Remember, what we 
try is to optimize for this, it's 

59
00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:35.997
basically to minimize or to maximize, in 
this case, to minimize this energy. 

60
00:04:35.997 --> 00:04:41.230
So this is a term that normally you put 
it in this kind of things, and here I'm 

61
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.512
assuming the image is between 0 and 1. 
It has been normalized, so the pixel 

62
00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:50.983
values are between 0 and 1. 
You say, you know, I want the image to be 

63
00:04:50.983 --> 00:04:53.873
nice. 
I don't want it just to be too far away 

64
00:04:53.873 --> 00:04:57.824
from the average grey values, and that 
you achieve by this. 

65
00:04:57.824 --> 00:05:01.973
On the other hand, you want contrast. So 
here is the contrast. 

66
00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:05.356
You don't want the pixel values all to be 
together. 

67
00:05:05.356 --> 00:05:10.712
If I don't have this term If I remove 
this term, the solution of this is a 

68
00:05:10.712 --> 00:05:16.192
constant value equal to half. 
All the pixels values are in the middle 

69
00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:19.387
all together. 
That's not what I wanted. 

70
00:05:19.387 --> 00:05:25.277
I want them to be nicely distributed, as 
expressed here, but I also wanted 

71
00:05:25.277 --> 00:05:29.267
contrast. 
And note that we have a minus sign here, 

72
00:05:29.267 --> 00:05:34.257
and, because I want to encourage Fix the 
values to get far away. 

73
00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:40.339
Now, I don't want them to go crazy far 
away, and that's why you add other types 

74
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:44.224
of terms. 
Now, we have integrals here, which is, 

75
00:05:44.224 --> 00:05:50.534
where do I count these? Do I count it all 
around the image? Now, this is also part 

76
00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:56.274
of your gain? You can say, hey, I'm 
going to just ask for these contrasts in 

77
00:05:56.274 --> 00:06:01.455
certain regions of the image. 
So, you can do the integral only for 

78
00:06:01.455 --> 00:06:06.750
certain regions of the image. 
Or you can say, I'm going to ask for this 

79
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.677
contrast only for certain. 
Ranges of pixel values. 

80
00:06:10.677 --> 00:06:15.987
So you can actually become very creative 
in, designing, this variation of 

81
00:06:15.987 --> 00:06:19.252
formulation, this same for this direct 
pd's. 

82
00:06:19.252 --> 00:06:23.577
Something that you couldn't do when you 
had to look up table. 

83
00:06:23.577 --> 00:06:28.282
It was like 1 to 1, from here to here, 
There's nothing in between. 

84
00:06:28.282 --> 00:06:33.844
Here, it gives you a lot of flexibility 
to become very, very creative. 

85
00:06:33.844 --> 00:06:38.644
So let's see some results of this. 
Here we have two examples. 

86
00:06:38.644 --> 00:06:44.195
Contrast enhancement here. 
Now the interesting thing here, you might 

87
00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:48.252
notice that basically, this is kind of 
localized. 

88
00:06:48.252 --> 00:06:54.824
Every region, kind of move by itself, and 
there no mixing of the region, and these 

89
00:06:54.824 --> 00:07:00.700
were achieved by playing with those 
eastern bound, boundaries, with those 

90
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:06.592
integration boundaries, sorry. 
And making sure that things that have 

91
00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:12.024
similar pixel values, or in this case is 
exactly the same piece of values, kind of 

92
00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:15.703
moves together. 
So, here's an example of an artificial 

93
00:07:15.703 --> 00:07:21.158
image to illustrate how these variational 
formulations can give you contrasting 

94
00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:24.639
enhansements that preserve the shapes of 
the image. 

95
00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:27.982
And here is another example of a natural 
image. 

96
00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:33.302
I hope you can appreciate that through 
the video, that this is a very dark 

97
00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:38.540
image, and here you have much vivid 
colors, a much nicer looking image. 

98
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.457
And this 2 examples are acheived with 
these PDEs, or variations and 

99
00:07:43.457 --> 00:07:47.236
formulations. 
Those are two different, and one gives 

100
00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:52.775
you some capabilities, the other gives 
you another capabilities, and playing 

101
00:07:52.775 --> 00:07:58.522
with the integral limits and playing with 
the terms inside the integrals, you can 

102
00:07:58.522 --> 00:08:04.086
start achieving the kind of application 
that you want for this type of contrast 

103
00:08:04.086 --> 00:08:07.985
enhancement. 
So I hope you enjoyed this example. 

104
00:08:07.985 --> 00:08:14.276
It illustrates both the concept of PD's, 
that we can almost achieve any condition 

105
00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:20.319
that we want if we run the PD to steady 
state, and also it illustrates how we can 

106
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:25.787
design variational formulation For an 
extremely important application that is 

107
00:08:25.787 --> 00:08:28.540
Contrast Enhancement. 
Thank you very much. 

108
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.651
Looking forward to seeing you in the 
future videos.
