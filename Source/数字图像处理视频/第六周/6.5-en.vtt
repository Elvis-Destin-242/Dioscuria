00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.114
Hello, and welcome back. 
We just finished learning about curve 

2
00:00:04.114 --> 00:00:07.622
evolution. 
There's one thing that is missing that we 

3
00:00:07.622 --> 00:00:11.332
need to learn. 
It's how do we implement curve evolution 

4
00:00:11.332 --> 00:00:15.177
in the computer. 
We saw that curve evolution is important 

5
00:00:15.177 --> 00:00:20.506
for example, to regularize curves with 
curvature motion, but even more important 

6
00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:24.620
for active contours. 
And we need to learn, how do we implement 

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.207
in that friendly fashion that in a 
computer we have discrete images. 

8
00:00:29.207 --> 00:00:33.390
So, we need to talk about the numerical 
implementation of that. 

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.149
one of the areas that has had a 
tremendous impact in image processing, in 

10
00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.908
particular, when we talk about PDs in 
image processing, is level sets methods 

11
00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:49.909
and I want to to explain that. 
And with that, we're going to know how we 

12
00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.683
implement any type of curve or surface 
evolution in a computer. 

13
00:00:54.683 --> 00:00:59.230
So what is all this theory, all this 
framework of level sets? 

14
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.631
So we have talk about curves and it's 
going to be the same for surfaces because 

15
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:07.886
it's much easier to present this for 
curves. 

16
00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:11.734
We have talk about curves and curve 
representations. 

17
00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:17.357
And we see that here, we have a curve 
that is parameterized and remember for 

18
00:01:17.357 --> 00:01:21.574
every P, we have basically a different 
point on the curve. 

19
00:01:21.574 --> 00:01:25.200
Now this is not the only way to represent 
curves. 

20
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.451
There's a very different way to represent 
exactly the same curve that is actually 

21
00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:35.432
even more familiar when we are talking 
about shapes. 

22
00:01:35.432 --> 00:01:41.174
And the basic idea is that instead of 
parameterizing the curve, we're going to 

23
00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:47.298
represent the curve by all the points on 
the plane that hold a certain equation 

24
00:01:47.298 --> 00:01:50.623
equal to zero. 
So let's look at this figure. 

25
00:01:50.623 --> 00:02:00.125
We're going to put a coordinate system x 
and y and then we say every point in the 

26
00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:05.494
curve is a point such that phi at that 
point is equal to zero. 

27
00:02:05.494 --> 00:02:11.957
So we have to describe this function phi. 
And for example we can define the 

28
00:02:11.957 --> 00:02:18.421
function to be positive inside and 
negative outside and one example is to 

29
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:25.276
define this as the distance to the curve 
for, for of course the distance to the 

30
00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:31.344
curve at the curve itself is zero. 
The distance to the point itself is zero. 

31
00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:36.118
So, every point on the curve has zero 
distance to the curve. 

32
00:02:36.118 --> 00:02:41.862
Every point inside has a positive 
distance, and we define every point 

33
00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:47.850
outside to be at negative distance. 
And that way, we define the function phi. 

34
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.903
That the zero set, that's called the zero 
level set of that function, meaning all 

35
00:02:53.903 --> 00:02:58.973
the points in the plain where that 
function is zero define a curve. 

36
00:02:58.973 --> 00:03:04.951
Let's look at a profile of this and we 
see that here. If I have a function that 

37
00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:11.004
is positive inside and negative outside 
and I cross it with a line, then this is 

38
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:14.810
the profile. 
We're going from negative tp positive. 

39
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.157
So this region is positive. 
Then we go again outside, so we have 

40
00:03:20.157 --> 00:03:24.342
negative again. 
And we go again inside and we go again 

41
00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:28.062
outside. 
Now which are the points that belong to 

42
00:03:28.062 --> 00:03:31.240
the curve. 
This point, basically, this zero. 

43
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.747
This point and this point and this point, 
every time the profile of five crosses 

44
00:03:37.747 --> 00:03:41.245
the zero, that point belongs to the 
surface. 

45
00:03:41.245 --> 00:03:47.671
In that way we are, belongs to a curve 
sorry or a surface if we are in higher 

46
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:51.250
dimensions. 
In that case, in that form we are 

47
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.513
defining a curve on the plane by all the 
points that hold this equal to zero. 

48
00:03:57.513 --> 00:04:03.451
And these two are just two different 
representations of exactly the same 

49
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:07.393
curve. 
This is kind of painting inside the curve 

50
00:04:07.393 --> 00:04:13.970
and painting outside the curve in such a 
way that along the curve that paint is 

51
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.450
equal to zero. 
Now. 

52
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.890
With this representation we have compute 
tangents, normals and curvature. 

53
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.640
We need to be able to compute it with 
this representation, otherwise, we won't 

54
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.217
be able to do curve evolution. 
So let's see how we do that. 

55
00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:30.746
And we're going to prove a couple of 
things. 

56
00:04:30.746 --> 00:04:34.693
As we have talked, this week is one of 
the most theoretical ones. 

57
00:04:34.693 --> 00:04:37.345
But we are doing everything 
self-contained. 

58
00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:42.094
So I'm explaining everything inside and I 
think we are learning a lot of new 

59
00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:45.934
concepts. 
So let us show that basically if we 

60
00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:52.230
define the curve as before at the zero 
level set of the function fee. 

61
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.473
The normal is the gradient of phi divided 
by the magnitude, actually, with a minus. 

62
00:04:57.473 --> 00:05:01.551
That's a convention because I want the 
normal to point inwards. 

63
00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:05.972
It's just a convention. 
And of course the tangent will be this. 

64
00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:12.378
It's basically a perpendicular vector. 
Let's prove that, it's not hard to prove. 

65
00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:19.367
So remember, we have the function phi and 
all the points that belong to the curve 

66
00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:25.600
is where phi is equal to zero. 
So along the curve, phi is not changing. 

67
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.729
It's always zero. 
When I travel the curve, it's always 

68
00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.923
zero. 
Then, the derivative of the function 

69
00:05:32.923 --> 00:05:35.636
along the curve. 
Along the arc length. 

70
00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:39.267
Because I'm traveling along the curve is 
equal to zero. 

71
00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:44.086
Let's compute that derivative. 
So I want to take the derivative of this 

72
00:05:44.086 --> 00:05:47.368
function. 
Remember, the function exists all over 

73
00:05:47.368 --> 00:05:52.745
the plane, and I'm taking the derivative 
in the direction of the curve in the, 

74
00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:56.769
with the arc length along the curve. 
Now, we have it here. 

75
00:05:56.769 --> 00:06:00.013
This is just the chain rule. 
Basic calculus. 

76
00:06:00.013 --> 00:06:03.861
So if I have to take the derivative 
according to s. 

77
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:09.520
It's the derivative according to x, 
x according to s, and the same for the y. 

78
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.198
So that's simple calculus. 
Now, what I wrote here is this inner 

79
00:06:14.198 --> 00:06:17.367
product. 
Remember, the inner product of two 

80
00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:20.913
vectors. 
So I'm going to write it here in case you 

81
00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:24.718
don't remember. 
If I want to multiply two vectors a, b. 

82
00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:31.272
I want to do the inner product, let's say 
with cd is a * c + b Time d. 

83
00:06:31.272 --> 00:06:37.912
So this is nothing else, now the inner 
product of the gradient of phi with the 

84
00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:41.965
time chain. 
Remember, xs, ys is the time chain, is 

85
00:06:41.965 --> 00:06:47.311
the unit time chain. 
We say that a couple of years ago when we 

86
00:06:47.311 --> 00:06:51.968
were talking about differential geometry 
curves of the plane. 

87
00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:57.315
And phi x, phi y is just a gradient. So, 
this is what we have here. 

88
00:06:57.315 --> 00:07:02.984
Now this is zero. 
Okay, we have it here. 

89
00:07:02.984 --> 00:07:07.698
Of course this is the zero. 
So I'm going to go here. 

90
00:07:07.698 --> 00:07:14.398
And, of course, I'm allowed to normalize. 
So here I have proof that the gradient of 

91
00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:17.736
the curve is perpendicular to the 
tangent. 

92
00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:22.505
Then I normalize the gradient. 
So if I have a vector that is 

93
00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:27.752
perpendicular to another. 
Of course, any change in magnitude in the 

94
00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:32.839
vector is still perpendicular. 
In particular I want to basically 

95
00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:38.005
normalize it to have unit norm. 
And then I get this equal to zero. 

96
00:07:38.005 --> 00:07:43.278
So if this is perpendicular to the 
tangent then this is the normal. 

97
00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:46.483
So I have a perpendicular, this is the 
normal. 

98
00:07:46.483 --> 00:07:52.223
And now once again, we as a convention 
put a minus because they, we want if we 

99
00:07:52.223 --> 00:07:58.112
have positive and negative we want the 
gradient to point, to point basically we 

100
00:07:58.112 --> 00:08:03.107
want the normal to point inwards. 
Once again, it's just a convention. 

101
00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:06.760
So a very simple proof that basically 
shows that. 

102
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.640
This is the definition of a normal so 
having phi, I can complete the normal 

103
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.456
with absolutely no problem and of course 
I can complete the tangent just a 

104
00:08:16.456 --> 00:08:21.118
perpendicular vector to it. 
And we have the first, actually we have 

105
00:08:21.118 --> 00:08:23.446
two. 
The normal and the tangent. 

106
00:08:23.446 --> 00:08:29.079
Now let us compute the curvature. 
And again a very simple computation as we 

107
00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:32.909
have here. 
Just maybe two more steps and we get the 

108
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.409
curvature. 
So what we want to show is that the 

109
00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:45.568
curvature, I only have phi, remember the 
curvature is the second derivative 

110
00:08:45.568 --> 00:08:49.648
according to s. 
So the curvature was cssKN. 

111
00:08:49.648 --> 00:08:51.624
equal kN. 
That's a curvature. 

112
00:08:51.624 --> 00:08:54.773
This is, I want to compute. 
I don't have c. 

113
00:08:54.773 --> 00:08:59.780
I have phi. 
I have c, the curve, the final implicitly 

114
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:05.595
by phi as its zero level set. 
And I want to prove that it's this 

115
00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:09.390
formula. 
In case you don't remember what div is, 

116
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:16.669
div is a divergence. 
And the divergence of a vector alpha beta 

117
00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:22.891
is basically alpha x + beta y. 
So it's a scalar. 

118
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:29.315
The first term of the vector, you take 
the derivative according to the first 

119
00:09:29.315 --> 00:09:33.372
coordinate X. 
The second, according to the second 

120
00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:34.724
coordinate, 
okay? 

121
00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:41.148
Let us prove this formula right now. 
So now, we are basically, are still going 

122
00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:46.219
along the zero level set so we still have 
this relationship. 

123
00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:51.122
And let us exploit it now. 
We are going to compute the second 

124
00:09:51.122 --> 00:09:55.648
derivative of phi along the curve with 
arc length. 

125
00:09:55.648 --> 00:10:01.251
We just compute the first one in the 
previous slide when we're computing the 

126
00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:04.016
normal. 
Now I want to compute the second 

127
00:10:04.016 --> 00:10:07.508
derivative. 
So I have the first derivative and I want 

128
00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:12.456
to take one more derivative. 
Now, once again, this was nothing else 

129
00:10:12.456 --> 00:10:18.350
than the gradient in our product with T 
as we saw the previous one and I have to 

130
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:23.724
take a derivative. 
Remember derivative of a final product is 

131
00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:31.467
the derivative of the first times the 
second plus the first times derivative of 

132
00:10:31.467 --> 00:10:36.500
the second. 
Now what's the derivative of the tangent? 

133
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.811
Second derivative is curvature in a 
normal direction. 

134
00:10:40.811 --> 00:10:44.553
So here it is. 
Curvature in a normal direction. 

135
00:10:44.553 --> 00:10:51.104
So once again, derivative of the first 
one times inner product with the tangent 

136
00:10:51.104 --> 00:10:57.459
and then the first one, inner product 
with the derivative of the second one, 

137
00:10:57.459 --> 00:11:01.780
which is T. 
But we know that the derivative of T is 

138
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:08.135
kN and this basically is equal to zero. 
So what we have, so this is equal to 

139
00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:16.060
zero, so what we have is that this turn 
is equal to minus distant and basically I 

140
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:22.880
wrote that here so this turn I can take 
the curvature outside, 

141
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.688
okay? 
That's not a problem. 

142
00:11:24.688 --> 00:11:28.096
It's a scalar. 
I can take it outside of the inner 

143
00:11:28.096 --> 00:11:30.670
product. 
That's the first thing we do. 

144
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:35.523
Oh, I apologize, there is here a typo, 
this should be a phi. 

145
00:11:35.523 --> 00:11:40.973
Basically a kind of a capital phi, but, I 
apologize for that typo. 

146
00:11:40.973 --> 00:11:45.997
We are going to continue. 
It's just that very easy to see that 

147
00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:52.469
going from here I just made a typo. 
And we basically have the curvature goes 

148
00:11:52.469 --> 00:11:56.642
outside, that's here, then we have this, 
again here. 

149
00:11:56.642 --> 00:12:02.773
And the normal we just saw in the 
previous slide, is gradient divided by 

150
00:12:02.773 --> 00:12:05.815
gradient. 
So we have curvature here. 

151
00:12:05.815 --> 00:12:12.728
Now this product is the gradient square 
because I'm multiplying this by itself. 

152
00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:19.817
So it's the gradient square divided by 
the gradient that cancel each other and I 

153
00:12:19.817 --> 00:12:23.160
get only one gradient. 
So this turn. 

154
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.387
Is here, okay? 
This term I'm not going to write it down 

155
00:12:27.387 --> 00:12:33.650
but by now you're an expert because we're 
just doing derivatives and chain rule. 

156
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:39.835
If you want to take the derivative of the 
gradient according to S, remember you 

157
00:12:39.835 --> 00:12:46.176
have to take the derivative according to 
X and then XS plus derivative according 

158
00:12:46.176 --> 00:12:49.621
to y, ys. 
So you do chain rule again and then 

159
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:54.734
you're going to get this expression. 
This expression is basically this 

160
00:12:54.734 --> 00:12:58.175
derivative. 
And then the tangent once again we have 

161
00:12:58.175 --> 00:13:03.738
from the previous one. 
Now we got this equality here if you now 

162
00:13:03.738 --> 00:13:11.200
open this with this definition your going 
to see that is identical to here. 

163
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.122
Times this. 
And then we got basically the formula for 

164
00:13:16.122 --> 00:13:21.880
the curvature of a curve that is 
represented in implicit form. 

165
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.660
Now pay attention this is extremely 
important this is going to be very 

166
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.902
important next when I explain the forming 
curves in level sets. 

167
00:13:30.902 --> 00:13:34.405
I don't need to have the curve I don't 
know c. 

168
00:13:34.405 --> 00:13:40.095
C, it's an implicit fashion define. 
All I need to know is phi and I take 

169
00:13:40.095 --> 00:13:44.077
regular derivatives in each direction, in 
the Y direction. 

170
00:13:44.077 --> 00:13:48.548
We know how to do that. 
So this is the x direction, this is the y 

171
00:13:48.548 --> 00:13:51.972
direction. 
We know, we just take derivatives as we 

172
00:13:51.972 --> 00:13:54.906
have been seeing many times in this 
class. 

173
00:13:54.906 --> 00:14:00.355
This pixel minus this pixel or this pixel 
minus this pixel when we are taking 

174
00:14:00.355 --> 00:14:05.176
derivatives in the Y direction. 
And we do that a number of times, just 

175
00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:08.530
following this formula and we get the 
curvature. 

176
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.913
or we got the normal, or we got the 
tension, so it's much simpler, I don't 

177
00:14:13.913 --> 00:14:17.359
have to go and take derivatives along the 
curve. 

178
00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:21.379
I take derivatives in the grid, basically 
in the image. 

179
00:14:21.379 --> 00:14:26.261
Really, really much simpler. 
So now we know the curvature, we know the 

180
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:29.132
normals. 
Do we know how to deform curves? 

181
00:14:29.132 --> 00:14:34.192
Let's see about that. 
So the next step is to learn how to 

182
00:14:34.192 --> 00:14:40.507
deform a curve. 
How to deform phi in such a way that the 

183
00:14:40.507 --> 00:14:44.849
boundary, basically, is deforming as I 
wanted. 

184
00:14:44.849 --> 00:14:51.560
So, we have a function that is 
representing a curve in implicit form. 

185
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.365
Okay? 
We know that the curve that is defined in 

186
00:14:55.365 --> 00:15:00.142
this way, it's moving with this velocity. 
And we ask ourself, 

187
00:15:00.142 --> 00:15:07.833
how do I have to change phi for the level 
set of phi to move according to this 

188
00:15:07.833 --> 00:15:11.638
velocity? 
And it turns out that it is this form. 

189
00:15:11.638 --> 00:15:16.334
And I'm going to prove to you here in 
just a couple of lines. 

190
00:15:16.334 --> 00:15:21.840
But before we do that, please pay 
attention to what's happening here. 

191
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.692
The phi is once again, it lives on the 
image. 

192
00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:30.285
It lives on the grid. 
Every time I'm talking about derivatives, 

193
00:15:30.285 --> 00:15:33.397
I'm talking about derivatives on the 
grid. 

194
00:15:33.397 --> 00:15:39.175
So the pixels are moving up or down. 
There's no derivatives on the curve which 

195
00:15:39.175 --> 00:15:43.472
are very difficult to implement. 
This is like when, we know. 

196
00:15:43.472 --> 00:15:48.732
We have seen how to compute a gradient. 
You know, again this minus this. 

197
00:15:48.732 --> 00:15:53.696
We have seen those things. 
So implementing this is much easier than 

198
00:15:53.696 --> 00:15:58.010
implementing this. 
Let us prove this formula. 

199
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:03.489
So, the basic idea is once again very, 
very simple. 

200
00:16:03.489 --> 00:16:09.303
I'm going to take the derivative of phi 
according to T, 

201
00:16:09.303 --> 00:16:11.901
okay? 
And this is where I'm going, 

202
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:16.277
I'm going to take the derivative 
according to T of this side, and the 

203
00:16:16.277 --> 00:16:20.322
derivative according to T of this side. 
Now this side is zero. 

204
00:16:20.322 --> 00:16:23.969
It's a constant. 
So the derivative of this side is also 

205
00:16:23.969 --> 00:16:25.030
zero. 
Here it is. 

206
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:30.789
The derivative here, I wrote it here. 
And now once again chain rule, and this 

207
00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:35.012
is what we have. 
The derivative of this function of x, y, 

208
00:16:35.012 --> 00:16:38.468
t according to t is what I have written 
here. 

209
00:16:38.468 --> 00:16:44.764
So I take the derivatives according to x, 
than xt plus the derivative according to 

210
00:16:44.764 --> 00:16:49.832
y, yt plus derivative according to t. 
These are partial derivatives. 

211
00:16:49.832 --> 00:16:52.290
So this is what I have. 
Okay, now. 

212
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:58.466
This I moved to the other side because I 
have a zero here and I get minus the 

213
00:16:58.466 --> 00:17:02.346
derivative according to t equal to the 
right hand. 

214
00:17:02.346 --> 00:17:07.568
So this part is equal to minus this. 
This we have seen before, 

215
00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:11.291
okay? 
It's an inner product as we have seen 

216
00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:15.620
already at least two times in the 
previous slides. 

217
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:21.767
So it's the gradient of phi because of 
this part and this part. 

218
00:17:21.767 --> 00:17:26.270
And this xt yt is ct is basically my 
curve deforming. 

219
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.623
So we are here now. 
We have one more step. 

220
00:17:30.623 --> 00:17:34.870
City, I know what it is. 
VN so I write VN. 

221
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.967
It's the motion of my curve exactly what 
I want. 

222
00:17:39.967 --> 00:17:47.400
So, once again the V can come out because 
it is scalar and I have this. 

223
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.691
Now, remember, I want to write everything 
as a function of phi. 

224
00:17:52.691 --> 00:17:55.472
That's the important part, 
okay? 

225
00:17:55.472 --> 00:18:01.212
So, we just saw that the normal is minus 
the gradient normalized, 

226
00:18:01.212 --> 00:18:01.930
okay? 
So, 

227
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:08.407
here we basically applied that. 
We replaced minus the normal by the 

228
00:18:08.407 --> 00:18:11.720
gradient of phi, normalized, 
okay? 

229
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:19.946
And this as before is gradient times 
gradient, that's gradient squared, divide 

230
00:18:19.946 --> 00:18:27.532
one gradient, we get one gradient. 
So this is gradient, this stays, and we 

231
00:18:27.532 --> 00:18:32.020
got this and because there's a minus 
here. 

232
00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:38.068
It counts as with the minus here and then 
we have that this is equal to this, which 

233
00:18:38.068 --> 00:18:40.400
is what we wanted to prove. 
Okay? 

234
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.011
So once again, you can look at this, if 
you want to just you can pause the video 

235
00:18:46.011 --> 00:18:50.747
now and look at the proof. 
There is nothing here but applying the 

236
00:18:50.747 --> 00:18:55.047
chain rule, and then writing everything 
as a function of phi. 

237
00:18:55.047 --> 00:19:00.148
That's the important part. 
we get that when we want to move a curve 

238
00:19:00.148 --> 00:19:05.940
according to V in the normal direction. 
That's obtained by moving feet up and 

239
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.978
down, whatever this formula tells us and 
then we cut. 

240
00:19:09.978 --> 00:19:15.569
So you want to go for t equal five, do 
this for t equal five, find the zero 

241
00:19:15.569 --> 00:19:18.830
level set and you got the curve 
evolution. 

242
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:24.809
So everything now is in implicit form. 
We have functions defined on the plane 

243
00:19:24.809 --> 00:19:30.555
and by moving those functions, we are 
moving the zero level set and we are 

244
00:19:30.555 --> 00:19:35.680
getting curve evolution, for example, 
we're getting active contours. 

245
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.321
Why is this so important? 
Let me just illustrate a couple of ideas 

246
00:19:41.321 --> 00:19:46.517
which I think will help us to illustrate 
how important this is. 

247
00:19:46.517 --> 00:19:52.621
So remember, that sometimes when we 
deform a curve, the topology can change. 

248
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:59.137
I'm going to ask you, which was the curve 
motion that produces changes in topology, 

249
00:19:59.137 --> 00:20:05.406
that might produce changes in topology? 
Is it the curvature motion, is it the 

250
00:20:05.406 --> 00:20:08.787
fine motion, or is it the constant 
motion? 

251
00:20:08.787 --> 00:20:14.002
We know that and we know that is the 
normal motion the normal motion can 

252
00:20:14.002 --> 00:20:17.593
change topology. 
Now when the topology of a curve is 

253
00:20:17.593 --> 00:20:22.978
changing if you discrotise the curve its 
very difficult to understand at this 

254
00:20:22.978 --> 00:20:28.433
point that was neighbor of this point 
that was neighbor of this point actually 

255
00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:32.266
ended up here. 
And this one ended up there and now there 

256
00:20:32.266 --> 00:20:36.567
not neighbors anymore. 
They were neighbors once step before, but 

257
00:20:36.567 --> 00:20:40.048
because of topological changes they're 
not anymore. 

258
00:20:40.048 --> 00:20:44.690
And numerical analysis is very 
complicated, when those things happen, 

259
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.810
when neighvor things, neighboring things 
just stop being neighboring things. 

260
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.383
It's very, very complicated. 
Now when we are in this phi function, so 

261
00:20:54.383 --> 00:20:59.640
imagine that this gray is the phi, and 
basically the two planes, the two green. 

262
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:05.822
Light green and dark green are just a 
different times you are cutting this feed 

263
00:21:05.822 --> 00:21:09.687
function. 
The feed function is moving according to 

264
00:21:09.687 --> 00:21:13.783
v gradient v. 
And all that I have to do is cut and be 

265
00:21:13.783 --> 00:21:17.106
surprised if there is a topological 
change. 

266
00:21:17.106 --> 00:21:20.430
I do not have to worry about 
connectivites. 

267
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:26.160
No worry at all, because I'm working on a 
grade, as I'm going to show here. 

268
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:31.155
So I don't have to work with particles 
and discretizer curve. 

269
00:21:31.155 --> 00:21:38.277
And remember who is neighboring with whom 
and how the neighbor, the neighborhood is 

270
00:21:38.277 --> 00:21:41.880
changing when there are topological 
changes. 

271
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:48.297
I don't have to do that. 
I'm basically working with phi defined on 

272
00:21:48.297 --> 00:21:53.067
a grid, as we have it here. 
This is just another profile. 

273
00:21:53.067 --> 00:21:56.970
And phi is changing. 
Phi t is V. 

274
00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:03.169
gradient, 
gradient phi and that's it. 

275
00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:07.550
So we discretize that the same way that 
we discretized before. 

276
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.789
It goes up, it goes down. 
An example you say, I want to know the 

277
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:15.817
state of the curve evolution right now. 
You just slice it. 

278
00:22:15.817 --> 00:22:20.834
You look at every place where the current 
phi is equal to zero. 

279
00:22:20.834 --> 00:22:24.650
You look at every coordinate or every 
coordinate here. 

280
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:29.051
If there is topological change or not you 
have to be aware of that. 

281
00:22:29.051 --> 00:22:34.438
And that's the beauty of this and that is 
how the active counters that we talk at 

282
00:22:34.438 --> 00:22:39.102
the end of the previous video is 
implemented with this where V is that 

283
00:22:39.102 --> 00:22:44.728
velocity of active counters so V can be 
in a simplified fashion G curvature. 

284
00:22:44.728 --> 00:22:51.226
Where G was this inverse gradient of the 
image or some function that makes it 

285
00:22:51.226 --> 00:22:55.307
stop. 
So you want to implement active counters. 

286
00:22:55.307 --> 00:23:06.838
All you have to do is phi t equal G 
curvature times the absolute value of the 

287
00:23:06.838 --> 00:23:10.264
gradient. 
And we know that the curvature, previous 

288
00:23:10.264 --> 00:23:13.551
slide, we can also compute as a function 
of phi. 

289
00:23:13.551 --> 00:23:18.866
So everything is a function of this 
surface that is defined on the grid and 

290
00:23:18.866 --> 00:23:23.831
that's the beauty of the level states. It 
simplifies the whole numerics. 

291
00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:28.446
And with it we can implement the 
curvature motion, constant motion, 

292
00:23:28.446 --> 00:23:32.572
constant motion is absolutely trivial. 
Let me write it here. 

293
00:23:32.572 --> 00:23:38.764
Phi t equal gradient phi. 
So the gradient you might discretize the 

294
00:23:38.764 --> 00:23:44.113
same way that we talked before. 
The pixel on the right minus the pixel on 

295
00:23:44.113 --> 00:23:47.850
the center. 
The pixel on the top minus the pixel on 

296
00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:52.100
the center. 
phi t, you discretize like phi of t + 1 - 

297
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.158
phi of t. 
Any type of time discretization. 

298
00:23:55.158 --> 00:24:00.928
We're not discussing a lot of numeric 
analysis like just relatively standard 

299
00:24:00.928 --> 00:24:04.451
numeric analysis that you can use to 
implement. 

300
00:24:04.451 --> 00:24:10.446
Smart numeric analysis but relatively 
standard instead of having to discretize 

301
00:24:10.446 --> 00:24:14.066
a curve. 
Very, very simple equations for as 

302
00:24:14.066 --> 00:24:18.895
complicated as we want curve evolutions, 
curve motions. 

303
00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:23.834
And I prove this only for curves. 
Happens the same four surfaces and 

304
00:24:23.834 --> 00:24:27.074
actually, the formula is exactly the same 
formula. 

305
00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:32.430
But phi is not function in higher 
dimensions so exactly the same formula. 

306
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.604
So, now you have the tools to do active 
contours. 

307
00:24:35.604 --> 00:24:40.762
And we are going to actually see more of 
active contours later this week in some 

308
00:24:40.762 --> 00:24:44.928
of the future videos. 
But you know curve evolution and you know 

309
00:24:44.928 --> 00:24:47.639
how to implement curve evolution, as 
well. 

310
00:24:47.639 --> 00:24:53.142
as I said we are learning a lot of new 
material and as I say, you can go back 

311
00:24:53.142 --> 00:24:57.704
and recheck this video. 
The proofs are really, really two line 

312
00:24:57.704 --> 00:25:03.250
proofs with basic calculus and algebra 
from very, very relatively simple 

313
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:08.405
calculus and algebra but you don't have 
to be aware of it. I just explain it to 

314
00:25:08.405 --> 00:25:11.863
you during this video and during the 
previous videos. 

315
00:25:11.863 --> 00:25:16.235
So we keep advancing and I'm going to see 
you again in the next video. 

316
00:25:16.235 --> 00:25:17.540
Thank you very much.
