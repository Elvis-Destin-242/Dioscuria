00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.716
Hello and welcome back. 
One of the fun things of this week is 

2
00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:07.790
that we are learning a lot of background 
material. 

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.190
While the background material is 
important for image processing, it's 

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.910
important for many other disciplines. 
For example, in the previous video we 

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.673
learned about level sets. 
Level sets are important in image 

6
00:00:20.673 --> 00:00:25.775
processing to the curve evolution like 
active contours as we have seen numerous 

7
00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.156
examples last week. 
We saw a few this week and we are going 

8
00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:32.090
to see more even in the next coming 
videos. 

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.161
Another topic that is very important in 
mathematics and is also important in 

10
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:40.257
image processing is the calculus of 
variations. 

11
00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:44.604
And that's what we're going to be talking 
right now in this video. 

12
00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:49.346
And then in the next video we're going to 
see an example of that for image 

13
00:00:49.346 --> 00:00:54.120
denoiseing and image enhancement. 
So what is calculus of variations? 

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.234
The idea is very simple, because it's an 
extension of finding extrema of 

15
00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:03.801
functions. 
But now we are going to be finding 

16
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:08.047
extrema of functionals. 
And what do I mean by that? 

17
00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:11.790
We're going to have images like you. 
And. 

18
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.750
It's derivatives. 
So this is going to be an image for us. 

19
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.346
And we're going to be looking at 
minimizing a function of the image. 

20
00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:25.791
Might be the image is square, might be 
the gradient of the image, might be the 

21
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:29.751
Laplacian of the image. 
So we're going to be trying to find 

22
00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:35.338
what's the image that minimizes that 
function in the same way that we tried to 

23
00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:39.157
find, what's the point that minimizes a 
given function. 

24
00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:44.460
For example, if I draw this function then 
you say oh, this is the point that 

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.018
minimizes it. 
But here, U is by itself what we are 

26
00:01:48.018 --> 00:01:51.755
looking for. 
So we are not looking for a coordinate, 

27
00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:55.419
we are looking for a function that 
minimizes this. 

28
00:01:55.419 --> 00:02:00.548
This is going to be very clear even in 
the next slide with an example. 

29
00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:05.458
And we are going to make all the 
connection of the minimization of 

30
00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.829
function X with the minimization of 
functions. 

31
00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:14.764
Now, we're going to discuss in a couple 
of minutes that a condition for U to be a 

32
00:02:14.764 --> 00:02:19.373
minimizer of this is to hold. 
This equation which is called the 

33
00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:25.071
Euler-Lagrange equation and this is the 
type of partial differential equation 

34
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:28.650
that we are going to be solving in image 
processing. 

35
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.348
Let me illustrate a bit more about this 
and then how we came to this equation 

36
00:02:34.348 --> 00:02:40.045
which is completely parallel to the 
minimization of regular functions that we 

37
00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:43.259
are away from regular standards in 
calculus. 

38
00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:48.300
So let's just illustrate, first of all, 
what do I mean by a functional. 

39
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.729
Let's assume that I'm giving two points. 
And I am asking you what's the curve 

40
00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:59.086
connecting these two points that has the 
minimum length. 

41
00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:05.000
So I am asking you for the function of 
that curve, the minimizer is going to be 

42
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.880
a function, not a point. 
The length of. 

43
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.002
Any curve, absolutely. 
Any curve connecting these two points is 

44
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:18.042
basically written here. 
The curve is parameterized as X Ux, we 

45
00:03:18.042 --> 00:03:23.991
know about that, that's the particular 
case of that parameterization for 

46
00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:29.493
basically any curve that goes. 
And connect those points. 

47
00:03:29.493 --> 00:03:34.370
the length is. 
As we know, the derivative of the first 

48
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.940
coordinate squared so that's one squared 
derivative of the second coordinate 

49
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.978
squared. 
So it's this function that we are going 

50
00:03:42.978 --> 00:03:47.245
to try to optimize. 
We already know what a function that 

51
00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:51.657
minimizes the length between two points. 
It's a straight line. 

52
00:03:51.657 --> 00:03:56.575
But let's see how we get that. 
You see calculus offers variations, so 

53
00:03:56.575 --> 00:04:00.120
I'm trying to find U connecting these two 
points. 

54
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.419
This is the condition for a function to 
be a minimizer of this function. 

55
00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.590
So it's that integral over a function of 
functions. 

56
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.390
We haven't arrived at it yet, but we're 
going to discuss it in a few slides that 

57
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.235
this is what happened. 
So F is square root of one plus UX 

58
00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:28.825
squared. 
So if you just do the numbers and takes, 

59
00:04:28.825 --> 00:04:35.370
you take this and do the derivative 
according to U minus the derivative that 

60
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:43.367
is written here, you get this expression. 
So this expression is nothing else than 

61
00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:51.040
applying this to f as written here. 
Now this equal to zero is a condition for 

62
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.905
the particular U we are looking for to 
solve the problem that we are searching 

63
00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:03.815
for, meaning the minimizer of the length 
connecting these two points. 

64
00:05:03.815 --> 00:05:09.030
Now we have this equals zero, the 
denominator doesn't matter. 

65
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.317
In when we have eight over B equal zero 
when its to be equal zero is U, so U 

66
00:05:15.317 --> 00:05:22.100
double derivative equal zero, that means 
that the first derivative is constant and 

67
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.230
then is that the function is 8X plus B 
that's a straight line. 

68
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.004
And A and B are found by what's called 
the boundary conditions. 

69
00:05:32.004 --> 00:05:35.566
We know that it has to go through these 
points. 

70
00:05:35.566 --> 00:05:41.628
So if I replace here X by a zero, I have 
to get this point and if I replace by X 

71
00:05:41.628 --> 00:05:46.100
one, I have to get this point and in that 
way, I get A and B. 

72
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.880
So we see that for length, the function 
that basically solves the Euler-Lagrange, 

73
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.287
and that's a necessary condition, is a 
straight line. 

74
00:05:57.287 --> 00:06:03.050
So basically, if we take this curve here, 
it will have certain length. 

75
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.345
But actually, the one that minimizes is 
not this because this is not a straight 

76
00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:12.533
line. 
The one that minimizes is this one. 

77
00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:18.750
So, a function to be a minimizer has to 
haul the Euler-Larange equation. 

78
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.270
Why is that important, and how do we get 
to the Euler-Lagrange equation? 

79
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:30.065
Let us go for a second back to regular 
functions, and how we find the minima of 

80
00:06:30.065 --> 00:06:34.509
a regular function. 
So you might not remember exactly how we 

81
00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.797
do that. 
But you do remember the result, which is 

82
00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:41.703
going to explain next. 
The basic idea is, you have a function. 

83
00:06:41.703 --> 00:06:45.060
And you have the function around a 
certain point. 

84
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.417
And you do a small perturbation of that 
function. 

85
00:06:48.417 --> 00:06:52.460
And you take the derivative according to 
that perturbation. 

86
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.872
And the condition for a point to be a 
maximum or a minimum is that when you do 

87
00:06:57.872 --> 00:07:01.230
any perturbation, the derivative is equal 
to zero. 

88
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:07.440
If you compute the derivative according 
to the permutation, you get this, and 

89
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.687
this has to hold for every n. 
So the derivative of the function for 

90
00:07:12.687 --> 00:07:18.365
every end has to be equal zero which 
means that this has to be zero, and we 

91
00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:22.227
know that. 
We know that the condition of a point to 

92
00:07:22.227 --> 00:07:28.057
be an extreme of a function is that it's 
derivative have to be equal to zero. 

93
00:07:28.057 --> 00:07:32.675
Now why is that so important? 
We know that but why is that so 

94
00:07:32.675 --> 00:07:35.704
important? 
Because then I can write this 

95
00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:40.216
differential equation. 
Xt so I can make X change in the 

96
00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:47.115
direction of minus the derivative and 
that basically says that you start from a 

97
00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:53.929
point and your next point, because X is 
changing in time, it just, you move a bit 

98
00:07:53.929 --> 00:07:58.327
in the direction of the derivative of the 
function. 

99
00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:04.700
Remember, derivative is tangent so you 
move a bit to the next spot. 

100
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.283
This is how you move. 
Your next point is this point minus a 

101
00:08:09.283 --> 00:08:12.780
tiny step in the direction of the 
derivative. 

102
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:18.840
That's what this equation is telling us. 
Because if we were to discretize this 

103
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.560
equation, we get that, that. 
X. 

104
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:35.606
We just saw the result there. 
We had the X at T plus Delta T minus X at 

105
00:08:35.606 --> 00:08:39.630
T. 
Divided by delta T, that's a [INAUDIBLE] 

106
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:45.900
equation of this. 
This expression is equal to minus fx and 

107
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:54.224
that's what we have here so we go slowly. 
In the direction of the derivative of X 

108
00:08:54.224 --> 00:08:59.054
until we get to this point. 
Let's just see that again. 

109
00:08:59.054 --> 00:09:05.523
We go one step and then we will go 
another step and another step until 

110
00:09:05.523 --> 00:09:12.084
basically we get to the steady state. 
In the steady state, we have the XT 

111
00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:16.093
equals zero. 
Nothing is changing anymore and, 

112
00:09:16.093 --> 00:09:20.528
therefore, this. 
Is = to zero, which is our condition. 

113
00:09:20.528 --> 00:09:27.016
So once again, we know that the condition 
for a point to be a minimal of a 

114
00:09:27.016 --> 00:09:31.312
function. 
Is it has to be the derivative = to zero. 

115
00:09:31.312 --> 00:09:36.310
So we take a point. 
I'm going to just show that to you again 

116
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:41.849
We take a point and we move it in the 
direction of the derivative and then 

117
00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:47.758
slowly we are moving it in the direction 
of the derivative and we are moving it 

118
00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:52.560
again until it doesn't move anymore. 
When it doesn't move anymore. 

119
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:58.534
This is equal to zero, which is the 
condition for it to be a minimum. 

120
00:09:58.534 --> 00:10:03.366
So we arrive to a point that is in this 
case a minimum. 

121
00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:08.550
So this concept extends to functionals, 
in the same fashion. 

122
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:14.427
Very simple again. 
We start from a functional, and then 

123
00:10:14.427 --> 00:10:19.930
we're going to ask u to be in extrema, so 
we do a perturbation. 

124
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:27.155
So, u is here, the yellow curve. 
It's basically our original function now. 

125
00:10:27.155 --> 00:10:31.390
We do a perturbation. 
Now, the perturbation, now, is another 

126
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.956
function. 
Because we're not talking about points. 

127
00:10:34.956 --> 00:10:39.785
We're talking about entire functions. 
So this is the perturbation. 

128
00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:44.540
And then u tilda is the sum of my 
function and the perturbation. 

129
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:50.630
And what I want is when I replace U by U 
tilde, I replace it by the perturbation 

130
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:56.341
and I take the derivative, according to 
the perturbation, has to be equal to 

131
00:10:56.341 --> 00:11:02.203
zero, the same way than when I did the 
point perturbation for functions, I got 

132
00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:05.553
zero. 
If I do a function perturbation here, I 

133
00:11:05.553 --> 00:11:09.588
have to get zero. 
From this, after a few lines of just 

134
00:11:09.588 --> 00:11:13.700
taking derivatives, we get the 
Euler-Lagrange equation. 

135
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:19.270
So that's how we get basically the 
Euler-Lagrange equation. 

136
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:24.650
Doing the derivative according to the 
[INAUDIBLE] that we are using. 

137
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:30.427
Once you have basically the 
Euler-Lagrange equation, you can do the 

138
00:11:30.427 --> 00:11:35.456
same that we did for functions. 
You can move your function in the 

139
00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:39.852
direction of the Euler-Lagrange equation 
until steady state, 

140
00:11:39.852 --> 00:11:45.613
when you get to state, you have solved 
your Euler-Lagrange equation. 

141
00:11:45.613 --> 00:11:49.706
So let's just illustrate that here. 
Look what happened. 

142
00:11:49.706 --> 00:11:53.420
I want to put that, basically. 
I want to do that again, 

143
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.233
okay? 
So you're going to basically move until 

144
00:11:57.233 --> 00:12:03.040
you get to the steady state. 
When you get to steady state, basically 

145
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.200
we've got zero. 
So let us recap what we just saw. 

146
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:13.784
In regular calculus, we basically are 
moving a point, not a curve, removing a 

147
00:12:13.784 --> 00:12:20.104
point in the direction of minus the 
derivative and basically we get, the 

148
00:12:20.104 --> 00:12:25.371
solution which is the minima. 
In the case of the calculus of 

149
00:12:25.371 --> 00:12:32.306
variations, we move, we move the function 
in the direction of the Euler-Lagrange 

150
00:12:32.306 --> 00:12:36.871
basically again the derivative for the 
perturbation. 

151
00:12:36.871 --> 00:12:40.623
We do that all the way to stay state, 
okay? 

152
00:12:40.623 --> 00:12:47.201
And just do that again. 
We do it all the way to steady state and 

153
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:52.062
at the point of steady state basically 
this became zero. 

154
00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:57.937
And we have solved the Euler-Lagrange 
which is the condition, basically, for 

155
00:12:57.937 --> 00:13:01.747
getting an extreme amount in this case a 
minima. 

156
00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:05.161
We can change the signs and get the 
maxima. 

157
00:13:05.161 --> 00:13:10.480
So we are going to see, in the next 
video, how we can take you to be an 

158
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.132
image. 
We'll do some interesting function of F. 

159
00:13:14.132 --> 00:13:19.532
And get, for example. 
Blurring the image or get image noisy. 

160
00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:26.290
So once again, our unknown is the image 
that basically optimizes this function. 

161
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:31.622
And we get the complete analogy between 
regular calculus and calculus of 

162
00:13:31.622 --> 00:13:37.540
variations and as I say for [INAUDIBLE] 
and even more for calculus of variations, 

163
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.631
these type of techniques go way beyond 
image processing. 

164
00:13:41.631 --> 00:13:46.306
What image processing did, and in 
particular the area of partial 

165
00:13:46.306 --> 00:13:51.347
differential equations, is to borrow 
these techniques from continuous 

166
00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:55.836
mathematics into this area. 
Once again, I'm going to show you in the 

167
00:13:55.836 --> 00:14:00.681
next video an example of a function that 
is very useful for image processing. 

168
00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:03.702
I see you in the next video. 
Thank you very much.
