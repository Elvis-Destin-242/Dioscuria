00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.198
Hello and welcome back. 
We have been talking so much about active 

2
00:00:04.198 --> 00:00:08.784
contours during this week as one of the 
examples of the use of partial 

3
00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:13.370
differential equations in image 
processing that I want to conclude the 

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.666
week with a bit more of details now that 
we know all the background material that 

5
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.444
we need. 
We know curve evolution, level sets, 

6
00:00:21.444 --> 00:00:24.333
calculus of variations, 
differentia; geometry. 

7
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.716
We have all those concepts that we 
learned this week. 

8
00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:32.374
Let's put them together in one of the 
active contours type of techniques. 

9
00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:37.873
So, let's just discuss that a bit more. 
We normally talk first about edge 

10
00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:41.980
detection. 
Now, edge detection, basically only talks 

11
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.073
about local churches. 
So it's basically giving us places where 

12
00:00:47.073 --> 00:00:53.070
there's a big change in the image. 
And, because sometimes we compute edges 

13
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.000
with radiant, for example, computing the 
radiant of the image. 

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.353
Then at every location we might have the 
strength of the edge, which is the 

15
00:01:03.353 --> 00:01:06.922
absolute value of these or the magnitude 
of these. 

16
00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:11.134
We might have the basic direction of the 
edges. 

17
00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:15.702
Remember that the normal to the level 
sets is in this direction. 

18
00:01:15.702 --> 00:01:20.671
So basically if we have an object. 
This is the level line, and then the 

19
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:26.318
gradient is perpendicular to it, so we 
also get the direction of the edges which 

20
00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:30.624
are in this direction. 
So we get a lot of information, but all 

21
00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:34.253
that information is local. 
As we see in this picture. 

22
00:01:34.253 --> 00:01:39.357
The goal of active counters as well as 
other techniques for example, was also 

23
00:01:39.357 --> 00:01:43.909
the goal of graph guides, is to integrate 
those local measurements. 

24
00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.183
If we look at this picture for example. 
That we see local representation of 

25
00:01:49.183 --> 00:01:52.412
edges. 
There are some basically spread around 

26
00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:58.297
edges, but if we look carefully, it looks 
like there is an object here and probably 

27
00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:02.746
another object here. 
So there is some relationship between the 

28
00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:07.913
local edges and that's what active 
counters is going to try, try to capture. 

29
00:02:07.913 --> 00:02:11.070
Let's just see that. 
That's what we want to do. 

30
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.807
We, I want to run that again. 
We basically want to integrate this local 

31
00:02:15.807 --> 00:02:20.623
measurements of image changes. 
And that's what active converse does, 

32
00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:25.807
exactly in the way I just showed it. 
It's just curves that move with the 

33
00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:31.278
equations that we have seen and we are 
going to discuss again, curves that move 

34
00:02:31.278 --> 00:02:36.102
towards those local edges. 
So, active converse basically starts from 

35
00:02:36.102 --> 00:02:39.371
an image. 
The first thing you do is you have to 

36
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:43.095
compute edges. 
You have to do these local computations. 

37
00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:46.613
There's a lot of art in how to compute 
those edges. 

38
00:02:46.613 --> 00:02:51.441
But that's always the first step. 
So you end up with an image that has, 

39
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:56.615
kind of, information about the local 
characteristics of the image, and often, 

40
00:02:56.615 --> 00:03:00.960
when we talk about active contours, we 
talk about this function. 

41
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.340
So we smooth a bit the image, and that, 
we know, by this time, we're in the sixth 

42
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.400
week, we know images are noisy. 
And very often we have to just clean the 

43
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.339
noise a bit. 
We take the gradients as indicator of the 

44
00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:20.226
local edges, this is just to make sure 
that we don't divide by zero. 

45
00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:25.259
So we basically take one over a 
regularized gradient or one over the 

46
00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:30.730
gradients of our regularized image. 
And that gives us count on indicator 

47
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.874
function of where should edges be. 
If there are, if there are edges, this is 

48
00:03:35.874 --> 00:03:41.361
very high so one over is very small. 
Once we have that, then the active 

49
00:03:41.361 --> 00:03:47.004
contours have to go and integrate that. 
Now, where is the active contours 

50
00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:53.053
equations that I showed you before and 
I'm going to show you again coming from. 

51
00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:56.669
One of the things is that, what is a 
curve? 

52
00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:02.007
What is an ice curve? 
An ice curve is a curve that goes around 

53
00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:07.344
areas where this image that is basically 
this one is very low. 

54
00:04:07.344 --> 00:04:13.457
Remember, once again, gradients very 
high, one other gradients very small. 

55
00:04:13.457 --> 00:04:19.473
So I want to find curves. 
That travel around regions that this 

56
00:04:19.473 --> 00:04:24.590
image is very small and this is 
represented here. 

57
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.641
I basically am integrating over the image 
G and I want that integral to be very 

58
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:35.431
small. 
That will be my curve for the active 

59
00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:38.516
contour. 
So, this is a function of g. 

60
00:04:38.516 --> 00:04:43.717
And I'm looking for the curve that 
minimizes that function. 

61
00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:48.829
We know what, how to do that. 
That's calculus of variations. 

62
00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:54.470
We're looking for a curve. 
That's a function that minimizes this. 

63
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.244
So, we plug. 
G in here and we do calculus of 

64
00:04:58.244 --> 00:05:03.327
variations and we get an equation for the 
active contours. 

65
00:05:03.327 --> 00:05:08.936
That's basically whole trick. 
So, once again, we do the local edge 

66
00:05:08.936 --> 00:05:13.318
indicator. 
We are looking for curves that are what 

67
00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:19.190
are called curves of minimal effort or 
shortest path in this space. 

68
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.021
We do calculus of variation. 
And we get the curve deformation that 

69
00:05:24.021 --> 00:05:27.827
moves the curve towards the minima of 
this function. 

70
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:33.244
Again, sometimes, just a local minima. 
We move it towards the minima of that 

71
00:05:33.244 --> 00:05:36.830
function. 
And those are curves that are traveling 

72
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.076
around low values of g. 
Which means, traveling around edges. 

73
00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:45.834
And that's basically how we get the 
equation for active contours. 

74
00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:50.752
Let's see that equation again. 
Before that I want to show you just one 

75
00:05:50.752 --> 00:05:54.020
example, think it's a nice example in 
ultrasound. 

76
00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.476
Those green curves are original curves 
and they deform, according to the 

77
00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:06.932
equation that we obtained from the 
Euler-Lagrange, towards the red curve. 

78
00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:13.030
The red curve is sitting in a place where 
if I integrate, if I sum G. 

79
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.428
All around these is low certainly much 
lower than the initial one. 

80
00:06:18.428 --> 00:06:23.990
And that's what the calculus of 
variations gave me that deformation. 

81
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:31.800
So let's talk about this function g. 
The function g, I'm going to just draw 

82
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.383
some graphs here, is basically, this is 
an image. 

83
00:06:36.383 --> 00:06:41.940
It's a very simple binary image. 
These are the edges of the image. 

84
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.873
Let's look at a profile. 
This is almost binary. 

85
00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:52.029
It looks in the screen as binary. 
The profile, when I travel here, it goes 

86
00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:54.680
up and down. 
So it's about this. 

87
00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.008
Now when you compute edges in this image, 
you are going to get basically high 

88
00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:06.499
values around these regions. 
And then if you do this, those are going 

89
00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:11.830
to be low values, and we know that. 
Remember, and we're going to see the 

90
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.866
equation again. 
Remember first of all we want to travel 

91
00:07:15.866 --> 00:07:21.045
in regions of low G, because the, we're, 
we're doing the integral of G. 

92
00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:25.310
So we want to go around regions with low 
G, as we see here. 

93
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.653
That's one thing and, remember, we want 
this G to be very small because we want 

94
00:07:30.653 --> 00:07:34.421
the curve, when it's evolving, to stop at 
the boundaries. 

95
00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:39.833
We don't want it to continue evolving. 
So that's one very important concept and 

96
00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:45.108
that's what we get from taking this G 
function, this potential function, to be 

97
00:07:45.108 --> 00:07:49.493
a function of the gradient and inverse 
function of the gradient. 

98
00:07:49.493 --> 00:07:54.768
Now, when we do the Euler, the, basically 
the Euler-Lagrange of the calculus of 

99
00:07:54.768 --> 00:07:57.901
variations of this. 
We got this equation. 

100
00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:03.045
That we see here. 
This is equation that I show you a number 

101
00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:08.887
of times to be basically the equation of 
the calculus of variation. 

102
00:08:08.887 --> 00:08:12.520
So this equation. 
That is minimizing. 

103
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.661
This is that. 
Curve evolution. 

104
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:18.943
The curve is evolving. 
We have seen this a number of times 

105
00:08:18.943 --> 00:08:22.413
already. 
And of course, this is implemented with 

106
00:08:22.413 --> 00:08:28.320
the level set, and I showed you in one of 
the previous videos, at the end, a slide 

107
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:34.080
with this equation in the level set's 
framework with an implicit function fit. 

108
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.297
So, this is the equation that is 
basically the gradient descent or the 

109
00:08:39.297 --> 00:08:45.112
equation that basically minimizes this, 
which is also called a Geodesic curve. 

110
00:08:45.112 --> 00:08:50.628
It's a curve of minimal weight and 
they're also sometimes called Geodesic 

111
00:08:50.628 --> 00:08:54.718
curves. 
Now we already saw in the previous slide 

112
00:08:54.718 --> 00:09:01.680
this function, and this is the function 
that gives us basically this, what we see 

113
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.770
here. 
Now it comes out from the minimization of 

114
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:11.166
these also, these term. 
What these term is doing, look, there's a 

115
00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:15.266
gradient. 
Of the potential function, not a gradient 

116
00:09:15.266 --> 00:09:19.310
of the image, a gradient of the potential 
function. 

117
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.517
And those are represented here by these 
green lines. 

118
00:09:23.517 --> 00:09:29.988
So it's not only that G gets very close 
to zero, and is going to try to stop the 

119
00:09:29.988 --> 00:09:33.709
evolution. 
Remember, if we don't have G, this is 

120
00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:37.430
curvature motion and it shrinks it to a 
point. 

121
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:44.445
This would try to stop the evolution but 
if we don't have an ideal age, this will 

122
00:09:44.445 --> 00:09:49.208
never be zero. 
Then it will slow down but it won't stop. 

123
00:09:49.208 --> 00:09:55.184
It will come here and it will kind of 
move because G is not zero yet. 

124
00:09:55.184 --> 00:10:01.939
It will maybe just move around or maybe 
even jump over, if G is not, not really, 

125
00:10:01.939 --> 00:10:08.331
really a very low and the curvature wins. 
So, this other term, that once again 

126
00:10:08.331 --> 00:10:12.310
comes natural from the calculus of 
variations, is. 

127
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:17.490
Basically pushing the curve. 
Towards the gradient of G, this green 

128
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.453
arrow. 
So it's saying, okay, but I'm going to 

129
00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:23.860
trap you. 
Because I have this term that is not 

130
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.230
going to let you go away. 
So this is kind of an extra velocity. 

131
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:33.772
And once again this part is because, 
remember, when we have velocities that 

132
00:10:33.772 --> 00:10:39.614
are not perpendicular to the curve, all 
what we care is that perpendicular are 

133
00:10:39.614 --> 00:10:43.957
the normal component, and this is what 
this operation does. 

134
00:10:43.957 --> 00:10:49.650
It projects it to the normal component. 
So we have a stopping term that says. 

135
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:55.020
Come to me, come very smoothly to me 
because you have curvature here. 

136
00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.360
Now we know that curvature motion 
smoothes the curve, stop when you get 

137
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.730
close to edges or at least slow down and 
this time traps you is pushing you 

138
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:13.520
because is at gradient of this function 
so is pushing you so you get stuck there. 

139
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.825
So that's basically what the active 
contours or in particular the geodesic 

140
00:11:18.825 --> 00:11:22.433
active contours. 
Sometimes they are also called the 

141
00:11:22.433 --> 00:11:28.022
geometric active contours because it has 
this curvature and a lot of geometric 

142
00:11:28.022 --> 00:11:32.196
components of the curve. 
This is what these geodesic active 

143
00:11:32.196 --> 00:11:37.714
contours are doing, are minimizing this 
energy, this geodesic energy, are trying 

144
00:11:37.714 --> 00:11:42.950
to find curves of minimal distance, 
minimal weighted distance with waves G. 

145
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:48.534
And they do that by doing calculus of 
variations getting to this curve 

146
00:11:48.534 --> 00:11:52.231
evolution. 
And implemented in, in the level size 

147
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:55.928
frame work. 
So everything together that we have 

148
00:11:55.928 --> 00:12:00.322
learned during this week is in this 
Geodesic Active Contours. 

149
00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:08.662
Now that was just an example basically in 
1D, what happens in 2D is basically the 

150
00:12:08.662 --> 00:12:11.975
same. 
It was an illustration in 1D, and what 

151
00:12:11.975 --> 00:12:16.753
happens here is we take the image, we 
smooth, you compute edges. 

152
00:12:16.753 --> 00:12:21.410
Let me just show you that again. 
You compute edges, 

153
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:27.802
local edges based on this function and 
then you basically evolve a curve, you 

154
00:12:27.802 --> 00:12:32.902
can start from a curve for example that 
surrounds the object, you just do some 

155
00:12:32.902 --> 00:12:36.368
initial condition. 
You can start with multiple curves, 

156
00:12:36.368 --> 00:12:41.141
remember we implement this with levis 
sense, we don't care about topology. 

157
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:46.503
So you can start with multiple curves or 
you can start with a curve around curves 

158
00:12:46.503 --> 00:12:49.249
inside. 
Just let them evolve and when they 

159
00:12:49.249 --> 00:12:53.696
evolve, boom. They get into the 
integration and if you sit at and I'm 

160
00:12:53.696 --> 00:13:00.480
going to just show you that once again. 
The initial curve has much more energy. 

161
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.410
So if I go and integrate. 
G. 

162
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:09.046
For the initial curve. 
It's much larger than if I integrate G 

163
00:13:09.046 --> 00:13:14.496
for the curve that we obtain at the end 
of the process, and that's a goal of 

164
00:13:14.496 --> 00:13:17.651
this. 
Curve evolution, once again, implemented 

165
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:22.671
in the level sets framework. 
So this Geodesic active contours are used 

166
00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:25.683
a lot. 
This is another interesting example. 

167
00:13:25.683 --> 00:13:30.918
I'm going to run it a couple of times. 
That we start basically from multiple 

168
00:13:30.918 --> 00:13:34.740
curves. 
Let them evolve with a function of G and 

169
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.518
basically we see that it attaches itself 
to the boundaries. 

170
00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:44.620
So look at the number five starts only 
from these two counters. 

171
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.985
And it evolves to detect. 
This red line is detecting the numbers. 

172
00:13:48.985 --> 00:13:53.895
And we see this in here, basically. 
We start from a bunch of contours, and 

173
00:13:53.895 --> 00:13:57.919
they evolve, and they get integrated to 
find the boundaries. 

174
00:13:57.919 --> 00:14:03.376
We went from the image to a G function. 
From it, we did the curve evolution using 

175
00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:08.559
level sets, and we get these solutions. 
You can basically observe a number of 

176
00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:13.525
different things here. 
And get, you know, as I said before, this 

177
00:14:13.525 --> 00:14:19.630
is level sets you can play very freely 
with the initial conditions. 

178
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:25.674
So this is one example. 
And active counters have been extended to 

179
00:14:25.674 --> 00:14:30.931
surfaces, so they're called active 
surfaces or minimal surfaces. 

180
00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:36.105
And here we see examples from grey matter 
segmentation in MRI. 

181
00:14:36.105 --> 00:14:42.030
So it's used a lot as we're going to 
discuss during the last week of this 

182
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.451
class. 
It's used a lot in medical imaging. 

183
00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:51.459
This is one example in 3D, this is 
another example in 3D of finding very, 

184
00:14:51.459 --> 00:14:56.525
very tubular type of structures. 
All these different examples use 

185
00:14:56.525 --> 00:15:01.171
different G functions that are basically 
adapted to the problem. 

186
00:15:01.171 --> 00:15:06.688
We talk about one over the gradient, 
sometimes we have much more information 

187
00:15:06.688 --> 00:15:11.769
about the type of images that we are 
using and then the art is in the 

188
00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:17.431
designing of that G function that will 
help the counter or the surface to get 

189
00:15:17.431 --> 00:15:22.820
basically attracted to the correct 
boundaries to the correct regions. 

190
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:28.306
So by this we are ending Week six. 
This has been a week where we learned a 

191
00:15:28.306 --> 00:15:34.459
lot of mathematical concepts in order to 
be able to do things like active contours 

192
00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:39.204
and isotropic diffusion. 
And there are many more applications of 

193
00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:43.726
partial differential equations in image 
and video processing. 

194
00:15:43.726 --> 00:15:48.397
I just illustrated a few. 
And I gave you some of the underlying 

195
00:15:48.397 --> 00:15:51.659
theory. 
It, it was as I say probably the most 

196
00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:57.133
mathematical-oriented. 
Week in this class, certainly these six 

197
00:15:57.133 --> 00:16:00.878
weeks. 
But it's also going to be the most 

198
00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:04.770
mathematical. 
Basically BC week of the whole class. 

199
00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:10.203
We're going to use PVs, also next week 
when we talk about image inpainting as in 

200
00:16:10.203 --> 00:16:13.308
our example. 
But as I say, every week is self 

201
00:16:13.308 --> 00:16:18.317
contained, so when you come to next week, 
of course you're going to, you are 

202
00:16:18.317 --> 00:16:22.692
already an expert in this area, so its 
going to be easier for you. 

203
00:16:22.692 --> 00:16:27.420
But I'm going to just talk about those 
equations, the ones that we use. 

204
00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.900
Next week and next week is not going to 
be as mathematical as this week. 

205
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.510
It's just going to use those PD's and it, 
there going to be very intuitive to 

206
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.821
understand. 
Imaging painting is a lot of fun and it 

207
00:16:39.821 --> 00:16:44.821
has a lot of relationship with biology 
and we are going to talk about that next 

208
00:16:44.821 --> 00:16:47.029
week. 
Thank you, I hope you had fun. 

209
00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:51.769
I know it was a hard week with a lot of 
math, but that's very useful math. 

210
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:55.859
So I'm very happy I was, I had the chance 
to teach you about it. 

211
00:16:55.859 --> 00:16:57.678
Thank you. 
See you next week.
