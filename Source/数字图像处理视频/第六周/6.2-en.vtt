00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.757
Hello. 
We're going to start with some background 

2
00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:08.930
in the area of planar differential 
geometry, the area of differential 

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.282
geometry and the understanding of curves 
on the plain. Before I do that, I want to 

4
00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:19.383
provide some credit. 
I work a lot in the area of partial 

5
00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:24.055
differential equations in image 
processing, and some time ago I wrote a 

6
00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:27.082
book.. 
My good colleague and friend Ron Kimmel 

7
00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:32.280
also wrote a book in the area and we used 
to give a lot of talks independently. 

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.347
I gave full semester classes, he gives 
full semester classes and sometimes we 

9
00:00:37.347 --> 00:00:42.276
give together tutorials on this subject. 
A lot of the slides I am using during 

10
00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:46.931
this week come from those tutorials and I 
want to thank Professor Kimmel for 

11
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:51.706
letting me share some of his slides and 
combining them with mine so that I can 

12
00:00:51.706 --> 00:00:55.546
provide the topic of partial differential 
equations in this week. 

13
00:00:55.546 --> 00:01:01.193
Thank you Professor Kimmel for that. 
now, let's talk about curves, so we can 

14
00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:05.846
describe what do I mean by differential 
geometry of curves. 

15
00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:11.052
So what's a curve on the plane? 
A curve on the plane will define a 

16
00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:14.680
coordinate system, and this is for 
convenience. 

17
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.015
We have the X axis and the Y axis and 
then we define a curve parameterized by 

18
00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:27.189
P, we called P the parameter. P runs 
between zero and one, and for every value 

19
00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.606
of P, we get a coordinate in this axis, 
and a coordinate in this axis, and that's 

20
00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:39.861
a coordinate of one point on the curve. 
So, basically, for example, for P equals 

21
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:45.380
0.1, we get this point. 
Then for a different p like 0.7, we get 

22
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.239
another point, and so on. 
So I'm sure you get the idea. 

23
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:57.572
Basically a different values of p within 
zero and one give us different points on 

24
00:01:57.572 --> 00:02:02.156
the curve. 
Now, if a curve is closed like here, what 

25
00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:06.275
we have is that c at zero. 
Is equal to C and one. 

26
00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:12.268
So it starts and ends basically on the 
same point, and that's a closed curve. 

27
00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:15.659
Now you're very familiar with this 
concept. 

28
00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.890
If maybe you're not so familiar with 
curves but for sure you are familiar with 

29
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.439
functions. 
So functions, you have a coordinate 

30
00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:31.196
system, X and Y as here, and you have a 
function, that for every value of X 

31
00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:36.480
there's one unique value of Y. 
That doesn't happen in normal curves. 

32
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.509
In that case your curve is parmitrized by 
this coordinate itself so we get c of x 

33
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.987
equal. 
The first coordinate is X by itself. 

34
00:02:48.987 --> 00:02:54.151
That's the first coordinate, 
and the second is some function of it. 

35
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:58.847
So these are just functions that you are 
very familiar with. 

36
00:02:58.847 --> 00:03:05.185
Again, the difference between a function 
and a general curve is that for each one 

37
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:10.804
of these coordinates, each one of the 
X's, there's only one Y, and that's why 

38
00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:15.123
it's called a function. 
There's a, basically a unique value. 

39
00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:20.707
So it's a particular case of a curve. 
We could think about curves also as a 

40
00:03:20.707 --> 00:03:26.664
generalization of functions on the plane. 
Now, once we understand the curve, which 

41
00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:32.026
is parameterized by this P, and we're 
going to discuss a lot about P in the 

42
00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:35.898
next few minutes. 
There's a couple of very important 

43
00:03:35.898 --> 00:03:42.861
concepts of curves on the plane, and two 
of them are the tangent and the normal. 

44
00:03:42.861 --> 00:03:48.887
And also what we call the curvature, 
which we're going to explain in a second. 

45
00:03:48.887 --> 00:03:54.261
Let's start from the tangent. 
Basically, we have a curve, and we can 

46
00:03:54.261 --> 00:04:00.287
take the derivative of this curve. 
So this is where differential equations, 

47
00:04:00.287 --> 00:04:06.895
differential geometry starts to appear. 
C_PP stands for the derivative of C taken 

48
00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:10.001
by p. 
So its basically CP. 

49
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:19.234
It's just a simplifying notation of the 
derivative of C with respect to P, which 

50
00:04:19.234 --> 00:04:25.390
is of course a vector, 
is the derivative of x with respect to p. 

51
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.930
C is a function of p, so I'm allowed to 
take the derivative of that, 

52
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.880
Y as a function of P. 
so this is what we have here and we 

53
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.306
normalize by its length, we want to get 
that unit length and that's actually 

54
00:04:42.306 --> 00:04:46.735
very, very important. 
As we are going to see, there is a 

55
00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:53.422
particular parametrization called S that 
provides us a tangent that has unit 

56
00:04:53.422 --> 00:04:56.191
length. 
And we're going to use that a lot. 

57
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:59.119
And we're going to see how we go from P 
to S. 

58
00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:03.442
But the basic idea is that we take a 
derivative of this curve. 

59
00:05:03.442 --> 00:05:08.810
And you learn in your basic calculus 
class that the derivative of a function 

60
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.412
gives you a vector which is 
perpendicular, but which is sorry, it's 

61
00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:15.121
tangent. 
To that function. 

62
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:18.508
In a second we are going to talk about 
perpendicular. 

63
00:05:18.508 --> 00:05:23.317
So once again, the derivative of a 
function gives you a vector which is 

64
00:05:23.317 --> 00:05:26.230
tangent to that function. 
So the derivative. 

65
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.560
Of this curve are vectors, which are 
tangent. 

66
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.017
And they don't have to have unit length, 
so we normalize them, and there is one 

67
00:05:37.017 --> 00:05:43.722
particular parmituzation we are going to 
write s that will give us a unit length. 

68
00:05:43.722 --> 00:05:48.854
And again we are going to see how we go 
from one to the other. 

69
00:05:48.854 --> 00:05:54.463
Now what we are going to, now that we 
have the tangent, and in particular, 

70
00:05:54.463 --> 00:05:59.976
bear with me for a second. 
We have the curve parameterized in such a 

71
00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:05.326
way that the tangent, meaning the 
derivative, is always unit length. 

72
00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:11.000
What do I mean by unit length? 
That the, basically the magnitude of the 

73
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.358
derivative vector is equal to one. 
Okay? 

74
00:06:14.358 --> 00:06:19.242
Unit length. 
Let's assume that I can basically write a 

75
00:06:19.242 --> 00:06:23.492
curve. 
Instead of a function of P, a function of 

76
00:06:23.492 --> 00:06:27.832
a different parameter S that gives me 
unit length. 

77
00:06:27.832 --> 00:06:32.345
Now length means, 
and I'm going to write this down and 

78
00:06:32.345 --> 00:06:38.055
explain again, this means that the inner 
product of the vector with itself is 

79
00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:41.776
equal one. 
If you don't remember what's the inner 

80
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:47.609
product between two vectors, is basically 
you multiply the first coordinate of 

81
00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:53.068
vector one by the first coordinate of 
vector two, and to that you sum the 

82
00:06:53.068 --> 00:06:56.657
product of the second coordinate of each 
vector. 

83
00:06:56.657 --> 00:07:02.341
So it's X of the first times X of the 
second, plus Y of the first, times Y of 

84
00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:06.230
the second. 
So that means that we have unit length. 

85
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:14.213
Let's take a derivative of this. So I'm 
going to take a derivative according to s 

86
00:07:14.213 --> 00:07:19.911
in both sides. 
So this is the derivative. 

87
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:26.233
A constant is always unit length, so this 
becomes zero. 

88
00:07:26.233 --> 00:07:33.758
The derivative of this is like any other 
product, it's the derivative of the first 

89
00:07:33.758 --> 00:07:41.008
times the second plus the derivative of 
the second times the first but because 

90
00:07:41.008 --> 00:07:48.351
these are equal then this is two times 
the inner product of the first derivative 

91
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:53.631
with the second derivative. 
It's like any other product, okay? 

92
00:07:53.631 --> 00:08:00.494
The two I can eliminate, and this means 
that the first derivative, according to 

93
00:08:00.494 --> 00:08:05.157
arc length, is perpendicular to the 
second derivative. 

94
00:08:05.157 --> 00:08:12.108
Once again, just to remind you, two, the 
inner product of two vectors is equal to 

95
00:08:12.108 --> 00:08:17.476
zero, if and only if one vector is 
perpendicular to the other. 

96
00:08:17.476 --> 00:08:23.009
So from here, 
we get that CS, the first derivative, is 

97
00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:30.216
perpendicular to the second derivative. 
Now the magnitude of the first derivative 

98
00:08:30.216 --> 00:08:34.220
is one. 
The second derivative, we have it here, 

99
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:40.092
is perpendicular to the first one. 
All the time when we are taking 

100
00:08:40.092 --> 00:08:47.210
derivatives according to s, the first is 
unit vector, the second is perpendicular 

101
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.960
to it. 
So this is the second derivative. 

102
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:57.682
Now it doesn't have to be a unit vector. 
Most of the time it won't. 

103
00:08:57.682 --> 00:09:05.219
And we call the magnitude of that second 
derivative we call the curvature. 

104
00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:12.569
This is the curvature. 
Okay, this is one definition of the 

105
00:09:12.569 --> 00:09:16.309
curvature. 
It basically tells us how much the 

106
00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:19.967
tangent is changing and it's very 
intuitive. 

107
00:09:19.967 --> 00:09:26.616
If it changes a lot, it means that the 
curve is curving along there and has very 

108
00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:31.188
high curvature. 
It it's not curving a lot, for example a 

109
00:09:31.188 --> 00:09:37.173
straight line has zero curvature, so 
what's a tangent of a straight line? 

110
00:09:37.173 --> 00:09:44.218
At every point it just changed colors. 
At every point the tangent is in the same 

111
00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:47.886
direction. 
It's in the direction of the line. 

112
00:09:47.886 --> 00:09:54.389
So the change of tangent, tangent is the 
first derivative, second derivative is 

113
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:58.140
the change. 
The change of the tangent is zero. 

114
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.975
So a planner, basically a straight line 
has zero curvature. 

115
00:10:02.975 --> 00:10:10.064
What's a curvature of a circle? 
So we have to, basically again, draw the 

116
00:10:10.064 --> 00:10:16.037
time change all the time. 
And then see how they're changing 

117
00:10:16.037 --> 00:10:20.479
infinitesimally when I move from one 
point to the other. 

118
00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:25.397
Those are derivatives. 
Derivatives means when you're very, very 

119
00:10:25.397 --> 00:10:31.188
close how is the tangent changing? 
First of all, it's constant because the 

120
00:10:31.188 --> 00:10:35.789
circle is all the same. 
So it has to be constant curvature. 

121
00:10:35.789 --> 00:10:41.660
And then it's not hard to prove that the 
curvature is one over the radius. 

122
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:47.340
Okay, so the curvature is one over the 
radius of the circle. 

123
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:53.435
The larger the circle, the more curvature 
it has, the, the, the, sorry, the larger 

124
00:10:53.435 --> 00:10:58.976
the circle, the more radius it has, one 
over the radius, the smaller the 

125
00:10:58.976 --> 00:11:03.013
curvature. 
You could think about a straight line as 

126
00:11:03.013 --> 00:11:09.346
a circle with infinite radius, very, very 
large radius and then one over infinite 

127
00:11:09.346 --> 00:11:15.757
is zero, so basically has zero curvature. 
So there's a lot of new concepts in this 

128
00:11:15.757 --> 00:11:19.320
very colorful slide. Let's go over them 
again. 

129
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.861
We have the tangent which is as we know 
from basic functional analysis, basic 

130
00:11:24.861 --> 00:11:27.955
calculus, is basically the first 
derivative. 

131
00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:32.776
We want to normalize it, we want to have 
unit length and there is a 

132
00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:38.245
parametrization, we're going to see how 
we get to it, that basically gives us 

133
00:11:38.245 --> 00:11:41.700
that the first derivative is always unit 
length. 

134
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.930
Always unit length we take a derivative 
of that concept and we get the second 

135
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:52.495
derivative which is always perpendicular 
to the first one only when we are talking 

136
00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:55.580
derivatives taking derivatives according 
to s. 

137
00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.160
And then that second derivative has a 
norm. 

138
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.260
Basic a demand to that vector and that's 
curvature. 

139
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.919
Curvature is the magnitude of the second 
derivative according to s. 

140
00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:12.370
This is going to be called the arc 
length, as we are going to see in a 

141
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.082
second why. 
So we have s, the arc length. 

142
00:12:15.082 --> 00:12:18.698
And we have. 
This is kappa, is the Greek letter kappa, 

143
00:12:18.698 --> 00:12:23.010
which is the curvature. 
Now we have s and the curvature and we 

144
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:28.504
talk about their relationship between the 
curvature and the radius of a circle. 

145
00:12:28.504 --> 00:12:32.260
These are actually the only two objects 
with constant. 

146
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:38.980
El cleanant curvature straight line zero 
a circle one over the radius. 

147
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.300
Now why are these guys s and curvature 
kappa. 

148
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:49.344
So important. 
Very important, because they're going to 

149
00:12:49.344 --> 00:12:54.918
be preserved under transformations of the 
curve, under certain transformations. 

150
00:12:54.918 --> 00:12:58.563
What kind of transformations can we have 
in curves? 

151
00:12:58.563 --> 00:13:01.493
So, I have here a curve. 
Where's the curve? 

152
00:13:01.493 --> 00:13:06.425
It's the boundary of my object. 
Now we are starting to understand why 

153
00:13:06.425 --> 00:13:11.856
differential geometry is important, 
because curves are boundaries of objects 

154
00:13:11.856 --> 00:13:17.216
and objects are present in images. 
Now, I can transform these in a number of 

155
00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:20.290
ways, but always preserving it on the 
plane. 

156
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:25.880
I generally transform is, I take my 
coordinates, which are a vector and I 

157
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.539
multiply by a matrix and I translate and 
I get a new vector. 

158
00:13:30.539 --> 00:13:36.285
And that's what called an define 
transform, if I don't put any limitations 

159
00:13:36.285 --> 00:13:42.419
in this matrix, so I take the curve and 
with an define transform, I transform it 

160
00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:46.755
into a new curve. 
Now, I can also just rotate my shape. 

161
00:13:46.755 --> 00:13:52.868
Here it has the form, it has stretch in 
different dimensions in different 

162
00:13:52.868 --> 00:13:57.061
directions. 
If I only want to translate and rotate, 

163
00:13:57.061 --> 00:14:03.940
so I rotate and translate or I translate 
and rotate, that imposes some limitations 

164
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:10.064
in A and it's not hard to show that in 
order to only allow rotations and 

165
00:14:10.064 --> 00:14:15.266
translations, the two vectors of A, so A 
is a two by two matrix. 

166
00:14:15.266 --> 00:14:19.880
I have here a vector multiplied by a two 
by two matrix. 

167
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.764
Sorry, 
a vector that I get it by a matrix 

168
00:14:23.764 --> 00:14:29.070
multiplying a vector. 
This has to have columns which are 

169
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:34.123
orthogonal, meaning the inner product 
means zero we just saw that in the 

170
00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:37.422
previous slide. 
Inner product equals zero means 

171
00:14:37.422 --> 00:14:40.862
orthogonal, and they also have to be unit 
vectors. 

172
00:14:40.862 --> 00:14:46.477
So this is just not hard to prove, but 
important thing here is that you can do a 

173
00:14:46.477 --> 00:14:52.093
rotation and translation that's called a 
Euclidean motion, or can you, or you can 

174
00:14:52.093 --> 00:14:57.568
do a general transformation and that is 
called an affine motion and of course 

175
00:14:57.568 --> 00:15:01.780
these are too or these are also related 
by an affine motion. 

176
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:09.466
Now there's a particular think in a fine 
motions that if they the determinant of 

177
00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:15.995
this matrix is equal to one then 
basically those are called equal 

178
00:15:15.995 --> 00:15:22.271
equi-affine motions, if the determinant 
is equal to one, what happens is that the 

179
00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:26.913
area doesn't change. 
So you can stretch differently, in 

180
00:15:26.913 --> 00:15:32.244
different directions. 
You can rotate, you can translate but the 

181
00:15:32.244 --> 00:15:37.058
area is preserved. 
Of course if you only allow Euclidean 

182
00:15:37.058 --> 00:15:43.420
motions, rotations and translations, the 
area is preserved, but if you allow. 

183
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:49.879
A fine transformation stretches there is 
none necessarily preserved but if the 

184
00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:54.540
determinate of the transformation matrix 
is equal to one. 

185
00:15:54.540 --> 00:16:00.454
Then it's not hard to show that the area 
of this object, so the area inside the 

186
00:16:00.454 --> 00:16:06.219
curve or the object itself is preserved 
and those I call equi-affine motions, 

187
00:16:06.219 --> 00:16:11.983
equi-affine transformations, and we're 
going to often just call them a affine 

188
00:16:11.983 --> 00:16:17.898
and we're going to assume that we are 
talking about those that we get with the 

189
00:16:17.898 --> 00:16:21.924
determinant equal to one. 
Now these are the type of linear 

190
00:16:21.924 --> 00:16:25.449
transformations. 
We're not going to discuss non-linear. 

191
00:16:25.449 --> 00:16:30.280
I can take X and square log Y, things 
like that we're not going to discuss. 

192
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.175
We're only discussing about multiplying 
by a matrix, so that means a linear 

193
00:16:35.175 --> 00:16:38.831
transformation. 
So we have Euclidean and we have affine, 

194
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:43.471
normally equi-affine. 
So now that we know that we can rotate, 

195
00:16:43.471 --> 00:16:47.390
stretch and do things like that, curves, 
meaning to shapes. 

196
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:52.090
Let's go back to, for a second, to 
curvature. 

197
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:57.972
We talk about these two guys. 
The arc length and the curvature. 

198
00:16:57.972 --> 00:17:03.974
The arc length is the parametrization 
that gives us constant unit length 

199
00:17:03.974 --> 00:17:07.838
tangents. 
The curvature is the magnitude of the 

200
00:17:07.838 --> 00:17:11.620
second derivative according to the arc 
length. 

201
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:18.114
So if we go around the curve, around this 
shape, we have, for every point a given 

202
00:17:18.114 --> 00:17:23.983
curvature and I'm drawing it here. 
So S as the parametrization goes around 

203
00:17:23.983 --> 00:17:30.284
the shape and for every S I have a point 
in the curve and then I have a curvature. 

204
00:17:30.284 --> 00:17:34.126
Now let's assume I do an Euclidean 
transformation. 

205
00:17:34.126 --> 00:17:39.274
I rotate and translate my shape. 
Something very interesting happens. 

206
00:17:39.274 --> 00:17:44.499
There are of course, corresponding 
points, this point got rotated and 

207
00:17:44.499 --> 00:17:48.033
translated to this one and here is the 
beauty. 

208
00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:52.260
There we have the same curvature, so the 
curvature here. 

209
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.475
And the curvature here, it's going to be 
exactly the same value. 

210
00:17:56.475 --> 00:18:01.225
So, if you were to take the first 
derivative, second derivative, measured 

211
00:18:01.225 --> 00:18:05.707
the magnitudes in both corresponding 
points, exactly the same value. 

212
00:18:05.707 --> 00:18:08.785
That happens for all the corresponding 
points. 

213
00:18:08.785 --> 00:18:12.331
So here we have another pair of 
corresponding points. 

214
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:16.613
We have the same curvature. 
Sometimes the curvature will be zero, 

215
00:18:16.613 --> 00:18:22.229
sometimes will be negative. 
Every pair of corresponding points has 

216
00:18:22.229 --> 00:18:26.293
exactly the same curvature. 
Every single point. 

217
00:18:26.293 --> 00:18:33.946
So basically if we have two shapes, that 
are related by a rotation and translation 

218
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:39.612
meaning an Euclidean motion, 
then their curvatures are identical. 

219
00:18:39.612 --> 00:18:46.566
Of course, you have to have a starting 
point, that is, the corresponding where 

220
00:18:46.566 --> 00:18:50.806
is S equal zero. 
Once you have that, exactly the same 

221
00:18:50.806 --> 00:18:55.130
curvature. 
So the curvature uniquely identifies the 

222
00:18:55.130 --> 00:19:01.745
shape, actual rotation and a translation, 
and that's beautiful. That's a theorem 

223
00:19:01.745 --> 00:19:08.073
that basically this curve uniquely 
identifies the curve a meaning the shape 

224
00:19:08.073 --> 00:19:12.196
inside a curve up to a rotation and a 
translation. 

225
00:19:12.196 --> 00:19:18.381
It actually has been shown these are 
beautiful results in transformational 

226
00:19:18.381 --> 00:19:23.844
geometry that every other thing that 
doesn't change with rotations and 

227
00:19:23.844 --> 00:19:27.393
translations. 
Every other differential thing is a 

228
00:19:27.393 --> 00:19:31.159
function of S and kappa, of arc length 
and curvature. 

229
00:19:31.159 --> 00:19:36.953
For example we could take the curvature 
and the derivative of the curvature, and 

230
00:19:36.953 --> 00:19:40.357
that gives us another crazy curve on the 
plane. 

231
00:19:40.357 --> 00:19:45.789
So for every curvature we, we look at, 
what's the derivative, how much is the 

232
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:49.990
curvature changing in that point? 
We do that for one shape. 

233
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.641
We do a rotation and translation. 
Voila. 

234
00:19:53.641 --> 00:20:00.128
We get exactly the same value. 
And that's theorem in part, basically due 

235
00:20:00.128 --> 00:20:06.690
to Cartan, and they're extensions of the 
theorem, some even more modern than these 

236
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:12.565
one's but it's the beauty of that, if you 
have the arc of S and the curvature 

237
00:20:12.565 --> 00:20:19.051
Kappa, you have all what are called the 
differential invariance, functions that 

238
00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:24.774
don't change when you basically do 
rotations and translations. So basically 

239
00:20:24.774 --> 00:20:30.048
they uniquely identify objects. 
That up to rotation and translation. 

240
00:20:30.048 --> 00:20:34.734
You cannot recover the rotation. 
They're invariant to them. 

241
00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:40.390
But basically they uniquely identify 
those objects up to rotation and 

242
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:45.888
translation in Euclidean geometry. 
Now what happens with affine 

243
00:20:45.888 --> 00:20:50.327
transformations? 
What happens when we don't just do 

244
00:20:50.327 --> 00:20:57.164
rotations and translation, but we also 
allow basically the curve, the shape to 

245
00:20:57.164 --> 00:21:02.580
stretch and with different stretches in 
different directions? 

246
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:09.041
Now unfortunately, or fortunately if you 
like math, not everything in the world of 

247
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:12.711
image processing is rotations and 
translation. 

248
00:21:12.711 --> 00:21:16.221
So let's assume I have a shape like my 
hand. 

249
00:21:16.221 --> 00:21:20.450
If I only do things like this parallel to 
the camera. 

250
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:25.000
I can model the motion of the object by a 
rotation. 

251
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:32.138
The moment I tilt it towards the camera, 
and then I do the projection of that on 

252
00:21:32.138 --> 00:21:38.651
the camera, then this is not any longer 
just a rotation and a translation. 

253
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:44.362
And one of the ways to model this is with 
these fine transforms. 

254
00:21:44.362 --> 00:21:48.070
So. 
Basically, if your object is relatively. 

255
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.580
On a plane relatively to the distance to 
the camera. 

256
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.577
Like here, for example, a drawing on a 
plane and we are looking, this is the 

257
00:21:56.577 --> 00:21:58.587
camera. 
Us, is the camera. 

258
00:21:58.587 --> 00:22:05.078
We are looking at kind of a plainer shape 
then there is affine transform. 

259
00:22:05.078 --> 00:22:12.253
So it is a more general multiplication by 
a matrix once again because I'm not doing 

260
00:22:12.253 --> 00:22:18.659
the rotation and the translations just 
in, in pilot place to the camera I'm 

261
00:22:18.659 --> 00:22:23.442
doing them a bit tilted. 
And that can be model by an affine 

262
00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:27.030
transform, a more general linear 
transform. 

263
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:33.683
So, we need to extend these basic 
concepts to basically allow for those 

264
00:22:33.683 --> 00:22:39.914
affine transforms. 
remember an affine transform is a more 

265
00:22:39.914 --> 00:22:42.063
generic, 
basically matrix. 

266
00:22:42.063 --> 00:22:48.118
We have the x and y, but we multiply by a 
more general matrix that normally has 

267
00:22:48.118 --> 00:22:52.257
unit determinant. 
We want to preserve areas just to make 

268
00:22:52.257 --> 00:22:54.940
our life easier. 
We don't need this. 

269
00:22:54.940 --> 00:23:01.072
We can do all this without, basically a 
unit determinant, but it's much easier if 

270
00:23:01.072 --> 00:23:05.288
we assume this. 
So, when we were talking about rotations 

271
00:23:05.288 --> 00:23:11.036
and translations, remember, we assumed 
that this column and this column were 

272
00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:12.110
orthogonal. 
So, 

273
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:15.542
basically, they're in a product equal to 
zero, 

274
00:23:15.542 --> 00:23:21.492
and they were also normalized to one. 
And those are rotations and then we have 

275
00:23:21.492 --> 00:23:25.611
a translation. 
When we assume more generic things like 

276
00:23:25.611 --> 00:23:30.035
here, just a unit determinant, 
those are affine transformed. 

277
00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:35.833
And we have kind of this tilting that 
basically gives us stretchings in the 

278
00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:40.333
different directions. 
So I want to define this arc length and 

279
00:23:40.333 --> 00:23:47.347
curvature for the fine case, as well. 
Now in order to do that, let me just talk 

280
00:23:47.347 --> 00:23:55.664
a bit more of what is parameterization. 
So I can have a curve parameterized by p 

281
00:23:55.664 --> 00:24:02.724
as before and can have it marameterized 
by r by a different parameter. 

282
00:24:02.724 --> 00:24:09.462
The curve will basically be the same. 
By R or by P the parameterization is kind 

283
00:24:09.462 --> 00:24:13.246
of telling me how fast are we traveling 
the curve. 

284
00:24:13.246 --> 00:24:18.999
Remember if you take the derivative of 
the curve according to p you get the 

285
00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:25.206
tangent vector with a certain magnitude. 
If you take the derivative according to R 

286
00:24:25.206 --> 00:24:30.808
you get the same tangent vector same 
direction with a different magnitude. 

287
00:24:30.808 --> 00:24:35.350
If you remember from basic physics 
derivatives are velocity. 

288
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.451
So you're only telling me how fast are 
you traveling the curve. 

289
00:24:39.451 --> 00:24:43.032
But you're going from the same point to 
the same point. 

290
00:24:43.032 --> 00:24:46.938
So it's like you are driving the highway 
between two points. 

291
00:24:46.938 --> 00:24:50.324
And the speed that you drive is the 
parametrization. 

292
00:24:50.324 --> 00:24:53.970
But the highway is the curve. 
The highway doesn't change. 

293
00:24:53.970 --> 00:25:02.903
So when we take functions geometric 
functions basically of our sorry I want 

294
00:25:02.903 --> 00:25:09.398
one more let me come back. 
When we take geometric functions of 

295
00:25:09.398 --> 00:25:13.385
curve, they have to be invariant to 
parameterizations. 

296
00:25:13.385 --> 00:25:19.366
The distance between two points in the 
highway does not depend on the velocity I 

297
00:25:19.366 --> 00:25:23.870
travel on that highway. 
So the geometric measurements that we 

298
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:29.260
take have to be invariant to the 
parameterization, and they also have to 

299
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:34.060
be invariant to basically the 
transformations that we want to do, 

300
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.939
either rotations or affine 
transformation. 

301
00:25:36.939 --> 00:25:42.424
So if you take a map and you rotate the 
map, the distance between two cities has 

302
00:25:42.424 --> 00:25:47.087
to remain the same distance, not just 
because I'm looking at the map 

303
00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:50.789
differently, it changes. 
It has to be invariant to that. 

304
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:55.726
So let's use this concept to define the 
arc length S that we saw before. 

305
00:25:55.726 --> 00:26:00.731
Let's just explicitly define it now and 
we are going to do the same for the 

306
00:26:00.731 --> 00:26:03.885
affine case. 
But let's start with Euclidean, so 

307
00:26:03.885 --> 00:26:09.377
basically, only allowing four rotations. 
So here is what we have, and this diagram 

308
00:26:09.377 --> 00:26:12.676
is very good. 
Assume that you have a curve going 

309
00:26:12.676 --> 00:26:15.675
through here. 
And you're going to take a very 

310
00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:19.088
infinitesimal, very small portion of that 
curve. 

311
00:26:19.088 --> 00:26:24.388
So I have, I can draw a coordinate 
system, like here and have a, very small 

312
00:26:24.388 --> 00:26:29.688
movement in the X direction, and a very 
small movement in the Y direction. 

313
00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:35.570
And then because of Pythagoras, this is 
basically X direction is perpendicular to 

314
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.446
the Y direction. 
So we have that this distance is the 

315
00:26:39.446 --> 00:26:45.651
square root of the X direction distance 
and the Y direction distance, each one of 

316
00:26:45.651 --> 00:26:47.950
them square. 
Simple Pythagoras. 

317
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:52.018
So now I'm allowing to multiply and 
divide by DP. 

318
00:26:52.018 --> 00:26:57.663
P is my general parametrization. 
So I multiply and divide by a small 

319
00:26:57.663 --> 00:27:01.897
change in P. 
Remember we're basically talking about 

320
00:27:01.897 --> 00:27:07.294
the curve going around here. 
So I'm going to just draw that, I have a 

321
00:27:07.294 --> 00:27:13.852
curve and I move a tiny bit X, a tiny bit 
Y and I measure how much I have moved 

322
00:27:13.852 --> 00:27:17.671
there. 
So I multiply and divide and this curve 

323
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:20.683
is CP. 
So I multiply and divide by DP, just a 

324
00:27:20.683 --> 00:27:26.241
small variation in the parameterization. 
And that's basically quality. 

325
00:27:26.241 --> 00:27:31.863
And now, I basically move this DP in, so 
I get DP squared. 

326
00:27:31.863 --> 00:27:33.670
Okay? 
I move it in, 

327
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:40.612
but I move it inside a square root, so I 
have to square it before, so I get this, 

328
00:27:40.612 --> 00:27:44.655
okay? 
This is DP stays and this is exactly the 

329
00:27:44.655 --> 00:27:51.686
definition of the Euclidean distance, the 
local, basically distance of the vector, 

330
00:27:51.686 --> 00:27:57.750
just basically the definition of that. 
So we got that DS is simply DP. 

331
00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:04.038
If we want to get the arc length S, it's 
basically the integral of that. 

332
00:28:04.038 --> 00:28:08.140
Okay? 
So this is the way to go basically from. 

333
00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:14.839
A generic parameterization P to the 
particular one S in such a way that the 

334
00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:21.451
derivative now basically is unit length. 
Always the derivative will be unit 

335
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:24.889
length. 
It will be a unit length vector. 

336
00:28:24.889 --> 00:28:31.941
And then the general distance of a curve, 
the total distance, distance of a curve 

337
00:28:31.941 --> 00:28:38.729
is the integral of everything from P 
equals zero to P equal one of CPDP, this 

338
00:28:38.729 --> 00:28:44.933
is the definition of the length. 
And if you basically replace what we have 

339
00:28:44.933 --> 00:28:51.540
here is the integral of DS from zero to 
the length so when your parmitrizing by s 

340
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.938
your not going from zero to one your 
going from zero to the length. 

341
00:28:56.938 --> 00:29:01.450
Basically once again. 
This tells us how to go from every 

342
00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:07.655
parameterization to A, so from every 
speed of traveling between two cities, if 

343
00:29:07.655 --> 00:29:12.248
you're basically integrating the 
magnitude of that speed. 

344
00:29:12.248 --> 00:29:17.405
Along the way you're getting kind of a 
unit length of traveling. 

345
00:29:17.405 --> 00:29:20.790
And that's what then lead us to 
basically. 

346
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:26.414
The Euclidean curvature when we took 
basically second derivative. 

347
00:29:26.414 --> 00:29:32.126
So this is for Euclidean. 
Now Euclidean rotations and translations 

348
00:29:32.126 --> 00:29:36.885
preserve length, and that's why I could 
use length here. 

349
00:29:36.885 --> 00:29:43.030
Now, in the affine case or in particular 
in the equi-affine case, 

350
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:47.848
length is not preserve anymore. 
What's preserved? 

351
00:29:47.848 --> 00:29:50.411
Area. 
So I can take areas. 

352
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:54.719
Now, in order to take areas, 
I need two vectors. 

353
00:29:54.719 --> 00:29:58.446
One vector does not define an area, I 
need two. 

354
00:29:58.446 --> 00:30:02.660
So, I'm basically going to take the first 
derivative. 

355
00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:07.485
It's always a tangent V is going to be 
now my affine arclength. 

356
00:30:07.485 --> 00:30:11.330
So the first derivative is not the unit 
vector. 

357
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:17.332
That's a characteristic only when you 
take derivatives according to S, to the 

358
00:30:17.332 --> 00:30:21.698
Euclidean arc length. 
So I take a first derivative, and a 

359
00:30:21.698 --> 00:30:24.427
second. 
Again, these two vectors not 

360
00:30:24.427 --> 00:30:29.260
perpendicular in general. 
That's a property only when you take 

361
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:35.107
derivatives according to arc length. 
And then I basically define the, I look 

362
00:30:35.107 --> 00:30:41.422
at the area and I'm going to look for the 
parameterization V that when I take first 

363
00:30:41.422 --> 00:30:47.806
derivative. 
Second derivative this area is equal to 

364
00:30:47.806 --> 00:30:52.176
one. 
I define it that way and basically you 

365
00:30:52.176 --> 00:30:57.739
can do all the math. 
We take, the first derivative is a 

366
00:30:57.739 --> 00:31:02.411
vector, 
and the second derivative is a vector, 

367
00:31:02.411 --> 00:31:07.395
and we put them here as vectors in a 2 by 
2 matrix. 

368
00:31:07.395 --> 00:31:14.766
So remember, this is a vector, this is a 
vector, so we get the 2 by 2 matrix. 

369
00:31:14.766 --> 00:31:18.193
It's of this form. 
It's basically. 

370
00:31:18.193 --> 00:31:25.045
Let me write it down explicitly. 
X, derivative B, Y, derivative B, XVV, 

371
00:31:25.045 --> 00:31:28.160
YVV. 
And that creates a matrix. 

372
00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.346
And I'm going to ask for the determinate 
of this matrix the determinate of a 

373
00:31:33.346 --> 00:31:38.802
matrix is the area of the parallelogram 
defined by these two vectors and now I'm 

374
00:31:38.802 --> 00:31:43.754
giving you a new concept at, at. 
A, group of concepts that you might not 

375
00:31:43.754 --> 00:31:47.500
be familiar with. 
But I am defining them on the way. 

376
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.715
So they, if I have a two x two matrix, 
this is a vector, this is a vector. 

377
00:31:52.715 --> 00:31:58.297
The determinant of these is the area of 
the parallelogram between these two 

378
00:31:58.297 --> 00:32:03.586
vectors, exactly what we have here. 
And I'm going to ask that to be equal to 

379
00:32:03.586 --> 00:32:07.064
one. 
And remember for euclidean we ask the 

380
00:32:07.064 --> 00:32:12.931
length to be equal to one here we ask for 
the area to be equal to one. 

381
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:19.635
I don't want to proof too many things to 
you but any parameterization p will give 

382
00:32:19.635 --> 00:32:25.670
a new parameterization that holds this 
property following this integral. 

383
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.163
Okay? 
So that's a theorem. 

384
00:32:28.163 --> 00:32:34.548
Just believe it for now. 
Now in particular, I can take p equal to 

385
00:32:34.548 --> 00:32:39.137
the Euclidean arc length. 
That's allowed to do. 

386
00:32:39.137 --> 00:32:44.324
So I can put cs and css. 
Now what are these two guys? 

387
00:32:44.324 --> 00:32:49.220
This is unit length. 
Okay, unit length, 

388
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:56.068
and the second derivative in the case of 
the Euclidean arc length, is 

389
00:32:56.068 --> 00:33:03.810
perpendicular to the first one, and it 
has basically length equal to curvature, 

390
00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:08.079
Euclidean. 
So this is one, this is curvature. 

391
00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:12.545
So, of course, this area is equal to 
curvature. 

392
00:33:12.545 --> 00:33:17.310
So we get that V, the, a fine arc length, 
gets its. 

393
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:22.230
Obtain by the integral of the kregen 
curvature to the one third. 

394
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:26.559
The S. 
And therefore what we get is an extremely 

395
00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:32.020
interesting relationship between the 
Euclidean arc length and defined arc 

396
00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.194
length. 
So we have the Euclidean arc length 

397
00:33:35.194 --> 00:33:40.876
coming from here and defined arc length 
and they're related by the Euclidean 

398
00:33:40.876 --> 00:33:44.271
curvature. 
This is a beautiful relationship in 

399
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:49.584
differential geometry that relates 
Euclidean differential geometry with 

400
00:33:49.584 --> 00:33:54.750
defined differential geometry. 
Now we have defined arc length, our next 

401
00:33:54.750 --> 00:34:00.153
step is to find defined curvature. 
How do we do that in a very similar 

402
00:34:00.153 --> 00:34:06.423
fashion as we did for the kleeant case if 
you remember in the kleeant case we 

403
00:34:06.423 --> 00:34:09.800
started by basically doing the 
derivative. 

404
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:15.405
Of the property. 
That this was equal to one we say the 

405
00:34:15.405 --> 00:34:21.991
length is constant and we took 
derivatives now we have to the area is 

406
00:34:21.991 --> 00:34:29.707
constant when we use the fine arc length 
so here remember is a determinant of two 

407
00:34:29.707 --> 00:34:33.108
vectors. 
And we're going to take the derivative. 

408
00:34:33.108 --> 00:34:37.521
The derivative of the determinant is like 
any other product. 

409
00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:43.332
We have to take the derivative of the 
first vector and then put the second and 

410
00:34:43.332 --> 00:34:47.157
then the derivative of the second and put 
the first. 

411
00:34:47.157 --> 00:34:51.791
So it's what we have here. 
The derivative of the determinant of 

412
00:34:51.791 --> 00:34:57.528
these two vectors, cv and c, vv, is the 
determinant here, derivative of the first 

413
00:34:57.528 --> 00:35:02.898
and we keep the second plus the 
derivative of the second and we keep the 

414
00:35:02.898 --> 00:35:06.657
first. 
Now if we have a determinate with two 

415
00:35:06.657 --> 00:35:13.292
identical columns that's zero so this 
basically is zero that's a very basic 

416
00:35:13.292 --> 00:35:19.440
property of linear algebra. 
So we end up that the determinant here. 

417
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:27.620
Is equal to zero which means once again 
that these two vectors are parallel. 

418
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:32.950
When we took derivatives here, we 
basically had that. 

419
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:38.607
In their product to be zero, the two 
vectors have to be perpendicular. 

420
00:35:38.607 --> 00:35:44.100
For the determinant to be zero, the two 
vectors have to be parallel. 

421
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.953
Another basic property again of linear 
algebra. 

422
00:35:47.953 --> 00:35:54.430
So the first and the third derivative, 
when I'm taking derivatives according to 

423
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.530
defined arc length, these two vectors are 
parallel. 

424
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:04.091
So they are basically parallel. 
One for example goes in this direction. 

425
00:36:04.091 --> 00:36:08.540
The other goes in this direction. 
The ratio between them. 

426
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:14.360
We define as defined curvature, the same 
way that we use the magnitude. 

427
00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:20.909
of the second derivative, according to 
Euclidean arc length, we use this as 

428
00:36:20.909 --> 00:36:26.972
Euclidean curvature, the ratio between 
these two parallel vectors is affine 

429
00:36:26.972 --> 00:36:31.014
curvature. 
And it's not hard to show that this new, 

430
00:36:31.014 --> 00:36:34.410
this affine curvature is an affine 
variant. 

431
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:41.349
What I mean is very simple if we take as 
we talk before, an affine transformation 

432
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:47.441
preserving area remember equi-affine. 
So we have a curve the boundary of a 

433
00:36:47.441 --> 00:36:51.250
shape and we're taking a fine 
transformation. 

434
00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:57.694
We compute the fine curvature of this 
shape as a function of the affine arc 

435
00:36:57.694 --> 00:37:02.310
length of the shape. 
we do the same for the new curve. 

436
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:08.950
And voila, they're identical. 
So in the same way as we have Euclidean 

437
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:15.863
properties, with S and Kappa, Euclidean 
arc length and Euclidean curvature, we 

438
00:37:15.863 --> 00:37:20.775
have them with the affine arc length and 
affine curvature. 

439
00:37:20.775 --> 00:37:26.870
They're basically the same, and they 
completely identify the object, 

440
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:31.991
up to on a fine transform. 
So now you're an expert on planar 

441
00:37:31.991 --> 00:37:36.219
differential geometry. 
You know the concept of arc length. 

442
00:37:36.219 --> 00:37:42.079
It is particular parametrization that 
gives us some interesting property about 

443
00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:45.936
the curve, like constant speed in the 
Euclidean case. 

444
00:37:45.936 --> 00:37:51.795
or constant area in the affine case, and 
then from that, we got the curvature that 

445
00:37:51.795 --> 00:37:55.545
is identical. 
For the Euclidean case, after rotations. 

446
00:37:55.545 --> 00:37:58.794
For the affine case, after affine 
transforms. 

447
00:37:58.794 --> 00:38:04.796
So those are very simple functions that 
uniquely identify shapes because they 

448
00:38:04.796 --> 00:38:09.561
uniquely identify curves. 
Now our next step is basically, let's 

449
00:38:09.561 --> 00:38:13.097
extend that a tiny bit to basically 
surfaces. 

450
00:38:13.097 --> 00:38:16.325
And we're going to do that in the next 
video, 

451
00:38:16.325 --> 00:38:22.320
and then you're going to have the basic 
tools of differential geometry to go and 

452
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:28.085
do the formations of curves and to do 
image processing and understand active 

453
00:38:28.085 --> 00:38:31.851
contours. 
So I see you in the next video for that. 

454
00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:32.620
Thank you.
