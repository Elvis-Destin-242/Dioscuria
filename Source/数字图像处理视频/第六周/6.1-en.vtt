00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.103
Hello, it's great to have you back. 
This is week 6, and the topic of this 

2
00:00:06.103 --> 00:00:10.610
week is partial differential equations in 
image processing. 

3
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.171
Some of you might remember, some of you 
might know what partial differential 

4
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:18.413
equations are. 
Some of you might not remember when you 

5
00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:22.134
studied that, maybe a long time ago, 
maybe just a few years ago. 

6
00:00:22.134 --> 00:00:26.515
But don't worry because every other week 
this is going to be a very self 

7
00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:29.877
containing week. 
Before I give you a bit more of details 

8
00:00:29.877 --> 00:00:34.798
of what we are going to learn this week 
let me try to explain to you what we mean 

9
00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:38.640
by partial differential equations what is 
kind of this new area. 

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.670
Relatively new area in imagine processing 
but certainly new for us in this class. 

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.227
So far we have been considering images at 
discrete objects in the computer. 

12
00:00:50.227 --> 00:00:53.340
If we look for example at the still 
image. 

13
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.707
We already talked it looks continuous to 
us but actually it is a connection of 

14
00:00:58.707 --> 00:01:03.667
pixels so its like this great two 
dimensional array of pixels as we have 

15
00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:08.899
represented here now they are so close to 
each other we already talked about 

16
00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.334
resolution they're so close to each other 
that it looks like a continuous image, 

17
00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:19.362
but actually it is a discreet object. 
It's representing the computer as a 

18
00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:22.420
discreet object. 
The same happens with movies. 

19
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.262
We already know that movies are discrete 
object. 

20
00:01:26.262 --> 00:01:32.426
They look continuous to us, like this 
movie that we are watching here, because 

21
00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:38.350
the sampling in time is basically very 
fast, and that's why our perception 

22
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.401
perceives this as a continuous object, 
but we already know that this is a 

23
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:50.327
discrete object. 
30 frames per second, 24 frames per 

24
00:01:50.327 --> 00:01:55.060
second. 
So images and videos are discreet both in 

25
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.413
space. 
In time and also at the gray levels. 

26
00:01:58.413 --> 00:02:02.804
They look continuous to us but they are 
discreet objects. 

27
00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:08.890
Now that leads us to what we have been 
doing most of these five previous weeks 

28
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.361
using tools from discreet representations 
from discreet mathematics because we have 

29
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:21.139
discreet objects in the computer. 
So what's different when we start talking 

30
00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:27.276
about partial differential equations. 
What's different is that we're going to 

31
00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:33.199
start considering continuous objects. 
So what we consider discreet objects the 

32
00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:38.515
way that videos and images are 
represented in the computer we see for 

33
00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:42.539
example, sums. 
We never saw the sign of an integral we 

34
00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:47.020
always talk about sums we talked about 
discreet operations. 

35
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.333
Also, every time we saw kind of a 
continuous object a derivative which is a 

36
00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:57.717
toll from calculus is a continuous object 
then we immediately discretize it. 

37
00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:01.330
Remember, we talked about, for example, 
it's derivative. 

38
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.278
Derivative indicates direction, and we 
say, okay, let's do plus one and minus 

39
00:03:07.278 --> 00:03:11.217
one here. 
So immediately we redefine its discreet 

40
00:03:11.217 --> 00:03:15.316
counterpart because we want to be in a 
discreet wall. 

41
00:03:15.316 --> 00:03:20.411
We want to be in a discreet space. 
The area of partial differential 

42
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:26.279
equations says forget about that the area 
of partial differential equations has a 

43
00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:31.718
completely different approach and says 
images are continuous objects do not 

44
00:03:31.718 --> 00:03:37.013
treat them as discreet images anymore 
that's just an artifact of computer 

45
00:03:37.013 --> 00:03:40.520
representations. 
Treat them as continuous objects. 

46
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.108
And then you basically are going to be 
talking about image processing that's 

47
00:03:46.108 --> 00:03:51.841
iterations of infinite decimal operators, 
things that happen at very, very small 

48
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:56.340
scale we iterate them. 
And when we are iterating them, actually, 

49
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.565
we get these partial differential 
equations, but once again if you don't 

50
00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:07.299
remember exactly what they are, we are 
going to explain that in the next videos. 

51
00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.710
Don't worry about that, the key concept 
is here. 

52
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.515
Images are not discreet objects, images 
are continuous. 

53
00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:19.236
So go and gather up all of your 
algorithms that are in your continuous 

54
00:04:19.236 --> 00:04:22.921
domain. 
Treat images as continuous objects, and 

55
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:28.978
then you can do partial differential 
equations you can also differentiate 

56
00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:33.234
geometry, tools that are from continuous 
mathematics. 

57
00:04:33.234 --> 00:04:39.208
All of a sudden, they are valid. 
They're powerful for basically discreet 

58
00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:43.873
image processing, but then you ask 
yourself, wait a second. 

59
00:04:43.873 --> 00:04:49.930
You gather up them, but my images are 
still discreet objects in my computer. 

60
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.067
But here comes to the rescue, numerical 
analysis. 

61
00:04:54.067 --> 00:05:00.877
Numerical analysis is exactly the area 
that says how do I implement continuous 

62
00:05:00.877 --> 00:05:05.446
algorithms? 
How do I implement continuous mathematics 

63
00:05:05.446 --> 00:05:11.825
in discrete domains like a computer? 
So you go and develop algorithms with 

64
00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:18.576
tools of continuous mathematics and then. 
Numerical analysis comes to the rescue 

65
00:05:18.576 --> 00:05:23.443
once we need to implement those 
algorithms in the computer. 

66
00:05:23.443 --> 00:05:28.804
So it's kind of a different paradigm. 
It's not better, its not worse. 

67
00:05:28.804 --> 00:05:35.073
It's different than the paradigm that we 
were used to before, when we consider 

68
00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:39.280
images from the very beginning as 
discreet objects. 

69
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.980
Now, 
why? 

70
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.460
Why is this happening now? 
What's going on? 

71
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.360
Why do we move from this, from this 
completely discreet, that basically if we 

72
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.572
look historically, has mostly dominated 
image and video processing for years and 

73
00:05:57.572 --> 00:06:03.687
years, until basically about ten years 
ago, and of course there are a number of 

74
00:06:03.687 --> 00:06:10.277
reasons why these continuous tools appear 
in image processing one is computers we 

75
00:06:10.277 --> 00:06:16.465
can more powerful and then numerical 
algorithms to implement this continuous 

76
00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:22.893
math that were impossible to have in a 
computer we can actually do able in even 

77
00:06:22.893 --> 00:06:26.510
small and personal computers of course 
every. 

78
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.112
New tools can because some people moved 
into the area and we should never forget 

79
00:06:32.112 --> 00:06:37.023
about the influence of people. 
So a lot of people in the last ten years 

80
00:06:37.023 --> 00:06:42.487
or so that were interested in continuous 
mathematics also became interested in 

81
00:06:42.487 --> 00:06:47.537
image processing and they brought their 
tools, their expertise into image 

82
00:06:47.537 --> 00:06:50.995
processing. 
Now we're going to see, as I said we're 

83
00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:55.353
going to see examples. 
I am going to provide you the background 

84
00:06:55.353 --> 00:06:57.331
but. 
What is it bringing to us? 

85
00:06:57.331 --> 00:07:01.390
It's going to bring a number of things. 
It brings new concepts. 

86
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.259
It brings accuracy. 
This is a very important thing, because 

87
00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:11.282
we are in continuous domain, 
and then we implement by numerical, 

88
00:07:11.282 --> 00:07:14.565
algorithms. 
The accuracy will depend on the 

89
00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:18.382
implementation, not on the design of the 
algorithm. 

90
00:07:18.382 --> 00:07:22.811
The algorithm is designed in the 
continuous domain, so there is no 

91
00:07:22.811 --> 00:07:27.392
intrinsic accuracy. 
Depending how much I'm willing to invest, 

92
00:07:27.392 --> 00:07:33.194
computation and resources for example, in 
the implementation that will determine 

93
00:07:33.194 --> 00:07:38.768
the actual accuracy of the algorithm. 
It's not intrinsic to the algorithm. 

94
00:07:38.768 --> 00:07:44.117
When I define a derivative at plus minus, 
plus one minus one, 

95
00:07:44.117 --> 00:07:47.938
I'm done. 
I have defined the accuracy of my 

96
00:07:47.938 --> 00:07:52.203
algorithm. 
Now if I define the continuum and, and 

97
00:07:52.203 --> 00:07:56.112
then say do the derivative the best you 
can, 

98
00:07:56.112 --> 00:08:01.000
I leave the door open to very high 
accuracy techniques. 

99
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.427
Another thing that was broad, that we are 
not going to discuss a lot in this class, 

100
00:08:06.427 --> 00:08:10.067
and certainly not in this week, is very 
formal analysis. 

101
00:08:10.067 --> 00:08:14.832
A lot of the techniques that came from 
the area of partial differential 

102
00:08:14.832 --> 00:08:18.538
equations to image processing have very 
formal analysis. 

103
00:08:18.538 --> 00:08:23.767
You can prove theorems, you can prove 
that what your doing is right even before 

104
00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:26.497
your going and implementing the 
algorithm. 

105
00:08:26.497 --> 00:08:31.064
So it's one of the most mathematical 
areas in image and video processing. 

106
00:08:31.064 --> 00:08:35.890
I'm not saying its the only one, but it's 
one of the most mathematical areas. 

107
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.753
And the consequences of this is that 
partial differential equation tools 

108
00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:43.684
brought a lot of state of the al-, 
algorithms. 

109
00:08:43.684 --> 00:08:48.947
But I think one of the most important 
things, and I want to leave you before we 

110
00:08:48.947 --> 00:08:54.734
go into details with this take home 
message, is that there are new tools and 

111
00:08:54.734 --> 00:09:00.085
new books in the bookshelf. 
So when you bring a new theory into an 

112
00:09:00.085 --> 00:09:03.572
area, 
you say, okay all these new frameworks 

113
00:09:03.572 --> 00:09:07.910
are now allowed. 
And it always good to have more tools to 

114
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:13.250
solve real problems, as we are going to 
see this week and a bit next week. 

115
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.634
So, what we're going to do this week is 
I'm going to give you the tools to 

116
00:09:17.634 --> 00:09:22.548
understand the underlying and the 
simplest possible tools to understand the 

117
00:09:22.548 --> 00:09:26.364
area of partial differential equations in 
image processing. 

118
00:09:26.364 --> 00:09:31.150
We're going to filter in examples that is 
going to show you to understand. 

119
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.738
Remember, last week we discussed active 
counters, that's one example of the use 

120
00:09:35.738 --> 00:09:40.268
of partial differential equations in 
image processing as we are going to see 

121
00:09:40.268 --> 00:09:44.857
very soon in one of the future videos. 
And we are also going to talk next week 

122
00:09:44.857 --> 00:09:49.328
about imaging painting and some of the 
algorithms we are going to subscribe 

123
00:09:49.328 --> 00:09:52.270
there are based on partial differential 
equations. 

124
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:56.440
As I said, is one of the most 
mathematical areas that we're going to 

125
00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.916
discuss during these nine weeks of 
classes in image and video processing. 

126
00:10:00.916 --> 00:10:05.454
But there's nothing to worry, because I'm 
going to introduce you to the basic 

127
00:10:05.454 --> 00:10:10.129
concepts and the basic tools that you 
need to understand the fundamental 

128
00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:15.216
concepts behind this area of partial 
differential equations in image 

129
00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:18.387
processing. 
And we're going to start learning about 

130
00:10:18.387 --> 00:10:22.000
those concepts right in the next video. 
Thank you.
