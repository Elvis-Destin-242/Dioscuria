Hello. 
Thanks a lot for spending another great week with me in this class on Image and 
Video Processing. We have learned a lot of topics related 
to image restoration. We're going to come back to image 
restoration when we discuss sparse modeling and we're actually going to show 
some state of the art results in image restoration. 
Until then, next week, we basically are going to explain image and video 
segmentation. It's a very exciting topic. 
It's used all around from consumer imaging to medical imaging, 
so it's a very, very important topic. And I'm looking forward to seeing you 
next week. Thank you.
