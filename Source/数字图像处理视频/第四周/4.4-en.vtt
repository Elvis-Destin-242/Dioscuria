00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.169
Now that we are experts on noise, let's 
see what happens to the histogram of an 

2
00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:09.553
image when you add noise to it. 
For that, we are going to use a very 

3
00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:13.217
simple example. 
We see here an image that has only three 

4
00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:18.190
regions and then only three values. 
If we were to draw the histogram of this 

5
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.097
image, we will see a different heights 
but we actually see on the three, 

6
00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:27.220
basically, delta functions. 
One that stands for the black region, 

7
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.986
one that stands for the gray region, and 
one that stands for this lighter region 

8
00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:38.103
and the height of these depends on the 
area of each one of the regions. 

9
00:00:38.103 --> 00:00:41.576
So, 
when we add noise, with each one of these 

10
00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:45.388
distribution, how is this histogram going 
to change? 

11
00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:50.312
It's going to change from this three 
delta function to something. 

12
00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:55.786
let's see what happens. 
So, here we see three examples already. 

13
00:00:55.786 --> 00:01:01.914
In the first example, we took the 
original image and we added Gaussian 

14
00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:04.748
noise. 
This the type of the probability 

15
00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:09.225
distribution of the noise. 
And we actually see it reflected here. 

16
00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:13.702
It's very clearly, they are kind of three 
Gaussian distributions. 

17
00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:18.808
This is going to be very important, it's 
going to help us to estimate the noise, 

18
00:01:18.808 --> 00:01:23.635
if we are only given the image, as we are 
going to see in the next video. 

19
00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:28.602
Here, we see a shape which is very 
similar to the shape of their Rayleigh 

20
00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:31.960
noise. 
It's kind of tilted and then it goes down 

21
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.803
almost like a Gaussian, slightly 
different. 

22
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.917
So clearly, the shapes here are very 
different. 

23
00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:41.302
For example, this is kind of symmetric. 
This is not. 

24
00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:46.311
Remember, these are probability 
distributional functions for the noise so 

25
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:49.493
we are not expecting to see a perfect 
function. 

26
00:01:49.493 --> 00:01:53.284
This all in probability. 
And here, we see the gamma noise. 

27
00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:57.887
Once again, a shape very similar around 
each one of the pixel values, 

28
00:01:57.887 --> 00:02:03.100
a shape that is very similar to the 
actual probability distribution function. 

29
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.067
So, these are the three of them. 
They just continue seeing some additional 

30
00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:11.433
examples. 
I'm going to ask you now a question. 

31
00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:16.006
Which noise do you think we added here to 
the original image? 

32
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:21.103
So, this is how the, basically, the image 
looks after we add the noise. 

33
00:02:21.103 --> 00:02:25.226
Which one of these six do you think we 
have added here? 

34
00:02:25.226 --> 00:02:32.202
Please give me an answer to that. 
I think it's not very hard to get to the 

35
00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:38.323
answer if we just compare the shapes. 
Once again, remember, if we only had the 

36
00:02:38.323 --> 00:02:44.935
original image, we have kind of three 
delta functions with different heights 

37
00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:49.058
representing the black, the gray, and the 
white regions. 

38
00:02:49.058 --> 00:02:52.876
And now, we see very clearly, exponential 
functions. 

39
00:02:52.876 --> 00:02:57.553
So, it was these noise, 
okay? We cannot see that from the image 

40
00:02:57.553 --> 00:02:59.555
itself. 
It's very hard to see. 

41
00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:03.492
Is this Gaussian, is this exponential, is 
this Rayleigh? 

42
00:03:03.492 --> 00:03:08.050
You have to really be trained to observe 
that just from the image. 

43
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.436
But it's much easier from the histogram. 
So now, that we are really experts I'm 

44
00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:16.336
going to ask you again, what's the noise 
here? 

45
00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:20.756
Please give me an answer. 
Just think for a second, and give me an 

46
00:03:20.756 --> 00:03:24.367
answer. 
Once again, this was the original 

47
00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:29.464
histogram and now, we actually see kind 
of uniform distributions. 

48
00:03:29.464 --> 00:03:32.729
So, we see clearly that this is the 
noise. 

49
00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:39.020
It's basically around the area of the 
original histogram with the flat regions. 

50
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.515
So, this is a type of noise. 
Now, please note that in this image, the 

51
00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:48.497
same type of noise was added all around 
the image. 

52
00:03:48.497 --> 00:03:53.821
Otherwise, for example, if we add 
Gaussian noise inside this region and 

53
00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:59.459
uniform noise to everything else, we will 
see actually a Gaussian here and uniform 

54
00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.103
in the other two. 
So, we will see combinations of these 

55
00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:06.541
distributions. 
Finally, this is the salt and pepper. 

56
00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:11.973
Salt and pepper actually is not hard, in 
general, to recognize from the original 

57
00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:15.136
image. 
We see the black dots or the white dots. 

58
00:04:15.136 --> 00:04:18.711
But I also want to illustrate that in the 
histogram. 

59
00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:24.143
The histogram stays with kind of delta 
functions but, of course, if there was no 

60
00:04:24.143 --> 00:04:27.690
black there would be a new delta function 
of black, 

61
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.326
or if there was black it would be a 
larger basically a taller delta function 

62
00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:37.835
there and the same for y. 
So, we can see from the histograms what 

63
00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:42.555
actually happens sometimes. 
And therefore, we can use the histograms 

64
00:04:42.555 --> 00:04:47.980
to estimate the type of noise and to 
estimate the parameters of the noise as 

65
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.080
we're going to see in the next video. 
Thank you.
