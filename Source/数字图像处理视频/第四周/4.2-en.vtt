1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.427
Let us now discuss the different types of 
noise that we can have in an image or a 

2
00:00:05.427 --> 00:00:08.273
video. 
normally, the way we do that is we 

3
00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:13.170
basically define what's the probability 
of the noise taking certain value. 

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.399
Remember, we are talking about adding 
noise to the image as we discussed in the 

5
00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:22.039
previous video. 
So let's just start with Gaussian noise 

6
00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.952
and I'm going to write down the formula 
for it. 

7
00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:30.246
So the probability of a certain value, 
this is a function that you have probably 

8
00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:37.031
seen a large number of times already, 
is 1 over square root of 2 pi sigma. 

9
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:45.220
That's basically, we are getting, 
they are the standard deviation of the 

10
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.487
noise. 
The exponent of minus c minus average. 

11
00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:59.005
We see it here, the average of the noise, 
square, that's very important, divided by 

12
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.809
2 sigma square, the variants of the 
noise. 

13
00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.030
So this is the formula for Gaussian noise 
and we see it's function here. 

14
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.697
Now, you might ask yourself, are there 
any real systems than, let's say when I 

15
00:01:14.697 --> 00:01:18.500
take an image, what I see is additive 
Gaussian noise? 

16
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.018
And unfortunately it's not, actually 
there's not real physical systems that 

17
00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:28.641
produce Gaussian noise. 
So, why is this such an important noise? 

18
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:33.581
This is probably the most used noise 
model in most of image and video 

19
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:36.582
processing systems for a couple of 
reasons. 

20
00:01:36.582 --> 00:01:41.608
One of them, because mathematically, is 
very easy to work with and we are going 

21
00:01:41.608 --> 00:01:47.261
to see that later during this, this few 
weeks of, of image and video processing 

22
00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:49.921
classes. 
And also, because it's a good 

23
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:55.644
approximation to other types of noise, 
especially when we look at small regions 

24
00:01:55.644 --> 00:01:59.049
of the image or small region of pixel 
values. 

25
00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.773
So it's very powerful and you're going to 
see most of the literature in image and 

26
00:02:04.773 --> 00:02:07.888
video processing addressing Gaussian 
noise. 

27
00:02:07.888 --> 00:02:11.438
And once again, here, we have the mean, 
the average, 

28
00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:14.771
and here we have the variance of, of the 
noise. 

29
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:16.510
Okay? 
So that's Gaussian. 

30
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.138
Now, let's just talk about Rayliegh 
noise. 

31
00:02:20.138 --> 00:02:26.817
In contrast with Gaussian, this actually 
does appear in real physical systems and 

32
00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:32.506
let's just write a formula for it. 
It's a big longer, but bear with me. 

33
00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:40.094
So the probability of a certain value. 
We're going to decompose it in two parts. 

34
00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:46.518
One is 2 / b and there is a few 
parameters as we see here, 

35
00:02:46.518 --> 00:02:49.091
2 / b, 
z - a, 

36
00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:57.799
e minus, z - a^2 as we have for the 
Gaussian, over b. 

37
00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:09.265
Now, that's the value that the function 
assumes if z is greater or equal than a 

38
00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:17.808
and is actually 0 if z is less or equal 
pictures, basically less than a. 

39
00:03:17.808 --> 00:03:21.360
Okay? 
So, it looks like a complicated formula. 

40
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.657
It has this quadratic exponential, the 
same as in the Gaussian, it's multiplied 

41
00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:31.128
by this and there's two parameters, b and 
a. 

42
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:37.343
And let me write down two important 
things before I describe you examples of 

43
00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:40.653
the Rayleigh, Rayliegh noise. 
One is the average, 

44
00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:46.062
it's not hard to compute, 
that the average of this is a plus square 

45
00:03:46.062 --> 00:03:52.858
root of pi b over four. So that's the 
average of the signal if we have that 

46
00:03:52.858 --> 00:04:02.308
type of noise. And the variance of the 
signal, of the sigma, of the signal I 

47
00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:09.571
apologize, is b(4 - pi) / 4. 
Okay? 

48
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:15.165
So these are for you, just formulas, 
and you know, simple models of the noise. 

49
00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:20.843
Now, this noise normally is used to 
model, for example, noise in certain 

50
00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:27.115
areas of, of magnetic resonant imaging. 
So, in contrast with the Gaussian noise 

51
00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:32.990
that is extremely good for us to 
basically do some math and do some nice 

52
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.476
restoration, 
but it's not really appearing in real 

53
00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:40.381
physical devices. 
This is a good model for real physical 

54
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:43.239
devices. 
As I say, for example, the magnetic 

55
00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:46.586
resonance is also used in under water 
imaging. 

56
00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:51.954
So there are many different disciplines, 
that basically the Rayleigh is a very, 

57
00:04:51.954 --> 00:04:57.462
very good model for, for that, for, for, 
basically the noise appearing in those 

58
00:04:57.462 --> 00:05:00.373
devices. 
Let's just, you have the gamma noise 

59
00:05:00.373 --> 00:05:04.100
here, the formula. 
Let's just talk about exponential noise. 

60
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.897
In the exponential noise, so once again, 
I just start by writing the formula. 

61
00:05:09.897 --> 00:05:18.549
The probability of z of basically a 
certain value of the noise is once again, 

62
00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:24.118
and this is going to be very important in 
a second, 

63
00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:30.280
e to the, is a, 
e to the minus az when z is positive, 0 

64
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.443
when z is negative. 
So, basically, the Rayleigh noise was 

65
00:05:35.443 --> 00:05:38.775
nonsymmetric, 
but the exponential, basically, 

66
00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:43.522
there was no noise. 
Basically, there is no negative values 

67
00:05:43.522 --> 00:05:47.603
of, of noise and that's a very important 
property. 

68
00:05:47.603 --> 00:05:53.149
Once again, 
the average, not hard to compute, is 1 / 

69
00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:57.381
a, 
and then sigma square is 1 / a^2. 

70
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:01.901
And you can have different numbers here 
depending on your scaling, 

71
00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:05.325
a is just a scaling. 
So this is the exponential noise. 

72
00:06:05.325 --> 00:06:10.255
Another popular noise, but I'm going to 
discuss the, when, can we see this 

73
00:06:10.255 --> 00:06:13.816
exponential noise? 
Actually, when I describe next the 

74
00:06:13.816 --> 00:06:17.514
uniform noise. 
So let me just first write the formulas 

75
00:06:17.514 --> 00:06:23.130
for the uniform noise, ask you a couple 
of questions about that, and then explain 

76
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.632
worries that we actually see this type 
of, of noise. So let's just write the 

77
00:06:28.632 --> 00:06:34.061
forumula for the uniform noise, the 
uniform noise is basically saying that 

78
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:39.930
there is noise of exactly the same value 
between these two. No noise outside and 

79
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.799
once you are inside, all the noise has 
basically is uniform, as the, as the name 

80
00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:55.540
says. So the probability is once again 1 
/ b-a if you are in this interval. 

81
00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.147
So basically, a less wqual than c, less 
equal than b. 

82
00:07:01.147 --> 00:07:10.055
0 if you're outside of the interval. 
So I'm going to write other. 

83
00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:13.006
Basically, you're outside of the 
interval. 

84
00:07:13.006 --> 00:07:17.325
So, uniform inside the interval 0 outside 
of the interval. 

85
00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:21.860
So let me ask you a question. 
What's the average for this noise? 

86
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:27.330
So look at this picture or if you want, 
do the math on the side and tell me, 

87
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.066
what's the average of this noise. 
Okay? 

88
00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:34.385
I'm going to give you, in the quiz, a 
number of possibilities. 

89
00:07:34.385 --> 00:07:38.620
And I'm going to respond to that in just 
one second. 

90
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.042
So what's the average here? 
Very easy to compute. 

91
00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:49.123
The average here is a + b / 2. 
So that's the average. 

92
00:07:49.123 --> 00:07:54.835
So if I'm having uniform noise, that's 
the average of my noise. 

93
00:07:54.835 --> 00:07:58.460
Okay? 
And how much is sigma squared? 

94
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:05.242
You're going to have that as one of your 
homework, as one of your quizzes for, for 

95
00:08:05.242 --> 00:08:09.304
week 4. Now, 
when do we see this type of noise? 

96
00:08:09.304 --> 00:08:14.901
For example, this is a very good model. 
Actually, both of them are good models 

97
00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:16.963
for quantization noise. 
Okay? 

98
00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:22.413
So, if you remember, in the, mostly in 
the first week, but also in the second 

99
00:08:22.413 --> 00:08:26.611
week, when we discussed image 
compression, we talked about 

100
00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:32.119
quantization. And the basic idea in 
quantization is that we had a range of 

101
00:08:32.119 --> 00:08:36.778
values and we represented it by a 
quantized value, 

102
00:08:36.778 --> 00:08:43.581
let's say, the point in the middle. 
So when you actually obtain this value, 

103
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:48.520
you actually represent it with a point in 
the middle, 

104
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.740
so you're making this noise. 
If you get this value, 

105
00:08:53.740 --> 00:09:00.125
you are making this noise. 
And that type of noise very often is 

106
00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:04.235
modeled as uniform noise inside this 
interval. 

107
00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:09.786
There's no noise outside that interval, 
because when you're quantizing, you 

108
00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:13.761
define an interval, 
and then you define, basically, the 

109
00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:19.162
representative of that interval. 
So uniform noise is a model for 

110
00:09:19.162 --> 00:09:24.188
quantization noise and that teaches us 
something new, a new concept. 

111
00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:29.814
Noise sometimes comes from the device. 
Let's say, the sensors in our cameras. 

112
00:09:29.814 --> 00:09:34.840
Noise, sometimes comes because of an 
operation that we do to images. 

113
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.440
And beautiful noise is a good model to 
this quantization operation. 

114
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.481
Exponential noise sometimes is also used 
as a good model for this quantisation, 

115
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:50.703
but it's also the type of noise or error 
when we do predictive coding. 

116
00:09:50.703 --> 00:09:55.700
Remember, in predictive coding, when 
we're trying to predict a pixel, 

117
00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:01.386
let's say, from it's surrounding pixels. 
So, what's the value of this pixel if I 

118
00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:05.586
tell you all this? 
That's what we did for predictive coding. 

119
00:10:05.586 --> 00:10:11.353
The error of that prediction is normally 
more than as an exponential error or an 

120
00:10:11.353 --> 00:10:15.340
exponential noise. 
For example, the JPEG or less standard, 

121
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:21.793
which is basically used in the Mars Rover 
uses this model for the error of the 

122
00:10:21.793 --> 00:10:26.286
predictive column. 
So very interesting these are really, 

123
00:10:26.286 --> 00:10:32.740
really useful, before I go to this we see 
these are useful to model for example 

124
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:38.703
operations that we do in images. 
This is very useful to model real sensor 

125
00:10:38.703 --> 00:10:45.320
noise, this is a very useful mathematical 
model to develop algorithms, so each one 

126
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.675
of them has it's own features and values. 
Lastly, I want to talk about impulse 

127
00:10:50.675 --> 00:10:53.713
noise and I can write down the formulas 
for these. 

128
00:10:53.713 --> 00:10:57.055
But let me explain it with a picture, 
it's much easier. 

129
00:10:57.055 --> 00:11:01.551
The basic idea on, on, on these type of 
noise, which is also called salt and 

130
00:11:01.551 --> 00:11:05.622
pepper noise, is that with certain 
probability you change the pixel 

131
00:11:05.622 --> 00:11:09.572
completely to a new value. 
And with certain other probability, you 

132
00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:13.704
change it to a different value. 
For example, we start that I go over the 

133
00:11:13.704 --> 00:11:18.140
image and with certain probability I'd 
change the pixel, let's say to white, 

134
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.339
and with other probability I change the 
pixel, let's say to black and that's why 

135
00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:27.693
it's called salt and pepper. 
If I changed it to white that's called 

136
00:11:27.693 --> 00:11:31.267
salt, and if I changed it to black, 
that's called pepper. 

137
00:11:31.267 --> 00:11:35.816
So we go over the image and we change 
pixels with a given probability. 

138
00:11:35.816 --> 00:11:38.676
It's very different than these types of 
noise. 

139
00:11:38.676 --> 00:11:42.315
The Gaussian noise will affect every 
pixel in the image. 

140
00:11:42.315 --> 00:11:47.261
The salt and pepper will affect some 
more, some not, but when it effects, it 

141
00:11:47.261 --> 00:11:50.903
effects all of them in the same, in the 
same fashion. 

142
00:11:50.903 --> 00:11:56.366
Turns them either white or turns them 
black with a different probabilities, so 

143
00:11:56.366 --> 00:12:01.059
it's a different characteristic. 
You can think about this noise, for 

144
00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:06.523
example, a noise to model when the 
probability is very low, actually sensors 

145
00:12:06.523 --> 00:12:09.815
defect. 
If one part one pixel in your camera is 

146
00:12:09.815 --> 00:12:13.737
actually burn for example you don't get 
signal there. 

147
00:12:13.737 --> 00:12:18.581
So that's kind of a pepper noise, it 
might be black so with, hopefully, very 

148
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:24.315
low probability, if your camera is a good 
camera, you get a pixel which is black 

149
00:12:24.315 --> 00:12:26.510
and that's a pepper noise. 
Okay? 

150
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.167
So these are very, very useful noise that 
we can see. 

151
00:12:30.167 --> 00:12:35.934
Now, what we're going to see next is how 
do we estimate this types of noise that's 

152
00:12:35.934 --> 00:12:40.646
going to be very important. 
It's going to be the topic of one of the 

153
00:12:40.646 --> 00:12:42.896
forthcoming videos. 
See you next. 

154
00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:43.600
Thank you.
