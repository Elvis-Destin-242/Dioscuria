Hello, and welcome back. 
We are going to benefit once again from 

2
00:00:03.483 --> 00:00:07.851
MATLAB to learn a few of the examples of 
different types of noise that we have 

3
00:00:07.851 --> 00:00:11.941
learned in the previous video. 
Let us, first of all, as we already know 

4
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:16.367
how to do that, load an image. 
This is one other image that comes with a 

5
00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:19.734
MATLAB packet. 
This in particular is a color image RGB. 

6
00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:23.662
So we are going to first transform it 
into a black and white image. 

7
00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:28.462
We're basically only going to be paying 
attention to the luminance component of 

8
00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:31.517
the image. 
That's this operation that we see here. 

9
00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:35.258
Then we're going to add Gaussian noise, 
that's what we see here. 

10
00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:39.809
So Gaussian means we are going to add 
Gaussian noise to this image and that 

11
00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.740
Gaussian noise is going to have a 
variance of 2. 

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.385
Then we're going to add salt and pepper 
noise with 2%,. 

13
00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:51.852
meaning 2% of the pixels in the image I 
are going to be changed to either black 

14
00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:56.198
or white, according to the definition of, 
of salt and pepper noise. 

15
00:00:56.198 --> 00:01:00.895
And then we are actually going to add 20% 
of salt and pepper noise. 

16
00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:04.820
So that's this image. 
Now, what we are going to do, is we are 

17
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.377
going to load all the images, 
the original color image, the black and 

18
00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:14.201
white version of that image, 
the Gaussian noise, the 2% salt and 

19
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:18.175
pepper noise, and the 20% salt and pepper 
noise. 

20
00:01:18.175 --> 00:01:23.118
So let's just see what happens. 
Once again, we are basically loading all 

21
00:01:23.118 --> 00:01:26.624
the images. 
Now, I'm going to move them so we can 

22
00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:30.406
look at them better, 
but I think you managed to see some of 

23
00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:33.816
that already. 
So there's a lot of images here. 

24
00:01:33.816 --> 00:01:39.792
And, let's see first the original image. 
This is the RGB, the color of image that 

25
00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:44.116
we loaded first. 
I'm going to remove that so we don't have 

26
00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:48.520
so many images on the screen. 
Here is the original image. 

27
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.724
Here is the result of finding the 
Gaussian noise. 

28
00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:56.760
The first observation you can see is 
basically there is noise all around the 

29
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.853
image. 
So, this is Gaussian noise. 

30
00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:03.170
Every pixel has some noise according to 
the Gaussian distribution. 

31
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.836
Contrary to that, we see here that 2% 
salt and pepper noise. 

32
00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:13.126
Some of the pixels of the image have been 
affected, only 2% of them. 

33
00:02:13.126 --> 00:02:19.115
Now, once they are affected, they become 
either completely white or completely 

34
00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:21.760
black as we see that here. 
Finally, 

35
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.728
we see what happens when we have 20% of 
noise. 

36
00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:31.580
So you see a lot of pixels that basically 
became either black or white. 

37
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.302
Once again, compared to only 2%, and 
compared to the Gaussian noise, that is 

38
00:02:36.302 --> 00:02:40.772
affecting all the pixels. And finally, 
then just look again at this nice 

39
00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:44.109
original image. 
So these are different types of noise, 

40
00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:49.020
Gaussian noise and salt and pepper noise, 
and basically different densities of 

41
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.239
noise for salt and pepper. 
We could also have played with different 

42
00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.772
variances for the Gaussian noise, but I 
think that this is sufficient to 

43
00:02:57.772 --> 00:03:00.731
illustrate the concept of these types of 
noise. 

44
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.880
Thank you very much and see you in the 
next video.
