Hello. 
Thanks a lot for spending another great 

2
00:00:02.622 --> 00:00:05.871
week with me in this class on Image and 
Video Processing. 

3
00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:09.348
We have learned a lot of topics related 
to image restoration. 

4
00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:13.111
We're going to come back to image 
restoration when we discuss sparse 

5
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:17.785
modeling and we're actually going to show 
some state of the art results in image 

6
00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:20.578
restoration. 
Until then, next week, we basically are 

7
00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:23.030
going to explain image and video 
segmentation. 

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.564
It's a very exciting topic. 
It's used all around from consumer 

9
00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:30.155
imaging to medical imaging, 
so it's a very, very important topic. 

10
00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.891
And I'm looking forward to seeing you 
next week.

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:33.462
Thank you.
