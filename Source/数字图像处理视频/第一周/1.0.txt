Hello and welcome to our Image and Video 
Processing class. We're going to be spending together nine 
weeks from this beautiful Duke University Campus. 
We're going to learn a lot of new material. 
We're going to travel to Mars, travel to Hollywood, go to the hospital, all thanks 
to Image and Video Processing. Before I give you some of the logistics 
of this class, let's walk right into my office which is behind this building, and 
I'm going to give you a few examples of the material we are going to learn during 
this nine weeks. So let's walk right in and see you in the 
next video. Thank you.
