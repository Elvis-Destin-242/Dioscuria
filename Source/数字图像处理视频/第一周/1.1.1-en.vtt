00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.575
Hello, and welcome back. 
As such I just mentioned in the previous 

2
00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:07.765
video we are going to now see a few 
examples of image and video processing. 

3
00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:11.787
That's going to help us to understand 
basically, what is image and video 

4
00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:14.469
processing. 
And it's also going to provide a few 

5
00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.715
examples of the material that we are 
going to learn during these nine weeks. 

6
00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:22.616
So let's dive right in. 
And we're going to start with an example 

7
00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:26.679
in scientific images. 
Scientific images are images that are 

8
00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.293
taken with a scientific goal. 
We want to do some science with those 

9
00:00:31.293 --> 00:00:34.460
images. 
And there's probably no better example 

10
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.867
than images from Mars. 
So we're all very excited when we get the 

11
00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:41.839
images. 
From the NASA JPL expedition to Mars. 

12
00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.360
These are really cool images, 
and we're seeing something that we have 

13
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.202
never seen before. 
Now, these images take a lot of space in 

14
00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:54.596
the computer in the Mars Rovers. 
They actually take a long time to 

15
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:57.991
transmit to Earth, because they are very, 
very large. 

16
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:02.385
So, NASA and JPL had to implement 
something inside the Mars Rovers, 

17
00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:07.178
something which is called image 
compression, to preserve the information, 

18
00:01:07.178 --> 00:01:11.505
but try to make that occupy less space, 
so it is faster to transmit. 

19
00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:15.166
We're going to learn. 
We're actually going to learn the 

20
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.495
algorithm that was implemented in the 
Mars Rovers. 

21
00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:23.530
I was lucky enough that one of my 
algorithms was selected to be implemented 

22
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.168
in a Mars rover. 
So we're going to learn it, pretty much 

23
00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:30.208
in detail. 
But of course, this is not the only 

24
00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:32.995
example, you know, about image 
compression. 

25
00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:37.548
If you use the digital camera, most 
digital cameras today use image 

26
00:01:37.548 --> 00:01:40.946
compression. 
If you're looking images over the web, 

27
00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:45.757
you're basically using image compression. 
Actually when you are watching this 

28
00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:50.327
video, this video is being compressed 
before it's uploaded to the web so you 

29
00:01:50.327 --> 00:01:53.574
can enjoy it. 
So we're basically doing image and video 

30
00:01:53.574 --> 00:01:57.543
compression all the time. 
So that's one example that in your daily 

31
00:01:57.543 --> 00:02:00.129
life, 
you're already seeing image and video 

32
00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:03.196
compression. 
There's another very important example, 

33
00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:07.225
and it comes in the movies. 
If you go to the movies, you're probably 

34
00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:09.210
have seen, 
you might not be aware, 

35
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.976
but you have seen image and video 
compression. 

36
00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:15.425
Let me give you an example. 
So here we have an image. 

37
00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:20.974
This is basically one frame of a video. 
It's a very famous video and what we, 

38
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:26.742
very famous movie and what we see here 
these are two consecutive frames so, one 

39
00:02:26.742 --> 00:02:32.655
coming right after the other and we see 
here that the actor is basically holding 

40
00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:36.073
a glass, 
and right after, he is holding a plate. 

41
00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:42.111
That's very surprising, how he switched a 
glass to a plane, that's actually a, to a 

42
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:45.466
plate. 
That's actually a mistake in the movie. 

43
00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:50.760
Here is another example, that we 
basically see the camera, the cameraman 

44
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.202
is in the picture. 
Of course, the director didn't want the 

45
00:02:54.202 --> 00:02:56.316
cameraman in the picture, 
but it is. 

46
00:02:56.316 --> 00:03:00.803
And actually, if you saw the movies, 
when they just came out and you pay 

47
00:03:00.803 --> 00:03:06.276
attention to them you actually might have 
been able to see the cameraman or to see 

48
00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:09.771
this mistake. 
There's actually mistakes in almost all 

49
00:03:09.771 --> 00:03:13.002
the movies, and there's a website that 
shows them. 

50
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:17.882
And basically if after that you go and 
see basically the DVD or different 

51
00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:22.366
versions of the movie, these repairs, 
these, these mistakes were repaired. 

52
00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:27.443
And how were they repaired with something 
called image and video in painting. 

53
00:03:27.443 --> 00:03:32.291
And we're going to learn about that. 
But let's see a few additional examples. 

54
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:35.897
Because sometimes we need to repair 
images and videos, 

55
00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:40.763
not just for the movies. 
So for example, here is a picture that 

56
00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:46.001
looks perfectly fine to us. 
It's actually a picture of Stalin. 

57
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:51.065
And so here we have Stalin. 
We see nothing wrong with this picture. 

58
00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:55.782
The only problem with this picture, this 
is not an original picture. 

59
00:03:55.782 --> 00:04:00.921
This was a picture that was inpainted by 
hand, because actually what really 

60
00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:03.948
happened was this. 
This is the real picture. 

61
00:04:03.948 --> 00:04:08.385
There was another person here, 
that the picture was retouched, 

62
00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:12.810
and this time, it was done long time ago. 
It was done by hand. 

63
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.610
It was retouched, so that the person is 
no longer in the picture. 

64
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:23.072
But, actually today we're going to learn 
how to do that with basically computer 

65
00:04:23.072 --> 00:04:26.668
techniques. 
Let's see other examples, because this is 

66
00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:32.407
very exciting and also there is a website 
which we provide those details in, in the 

67
00:04:32.407 --> 00:04:36.349
class web page that provides a lot of 
examples like this. 

68
00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.843
This is really a fine area. 
So, here is a frame of a Monty Python 

69
00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:45.200
movie, and as you see its scratches are 
being made to disappear. 

70
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.259
So, sometimes, you have a very nice image 
that somebody scratch in it, and you want 

71
00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.880
to make those scratches disappear. 
What you are seeing now is a simulation 

72
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.939
for real image processing algorithm that 
is making that scratch slowly disappear. 

73
00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.500
And that's going to be part of what we're 
going to learn. 

74
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.299
We talked about image compression, that's 
going to be about the second week of this 

75
00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:10.959
class. 
Imaging painting and medium painting is 

76
00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:13.792
going to be towards the second half of 
the class. 

77
00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:19.006
Let's see more examples. 
Here we see a perfectly nice video, this 

78
00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:25.340
is one of my former students, Keller, 
walking in front of the library at the 

79
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.249
University of Minnesota. 
Doesn't look like anything strange in 

80
00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.430
this video. 
Only that this was the actual video. 

81
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:41.120
Actually, killers wife was walking in 
front of him, then we applied, 

82
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.070
image and video processing algorithms, to 
make her disappear from the video. 

83
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.573
Sometimes we want to get special effects 
in videos. 

84
00:05:49.573 --> 00:05:55.205
So this is an example of special effects. 
We actually start from a black and white 

85
00:05:55.205 --> 00:05:58.158
movie. 
And here we see a few frames of that 

86
00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:02.554
black and white movie. 
We provide a few hints of some color that 

87
00:06:02.554 --> 00:06:06.744
we want to add to the video, and here is 
the automatic result. 

88
00:06:06.744 --> 00:06:12.308
Just from hints, actually in this case in 
just one frame, we get a colorized movie. 

89
00:06:12.308 --> 00:06:17.460
So it's like we're in painting but we're 
in painting colors into the movie, 

90
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.614
just on our special effect. 
Special effects are all over, and you 

91
00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:24.990
need a lot of image and video processing 
to do them. 

92
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.275
So here is another example. 
Let me run it first, so it's easier for 

93
00:06:29.275 --> 00:06:33.494
me to explain the special effect. 
At first you see kind of blurry. 

94
00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:37.390
This looks like a blurry video. 
But look what's going to happen. 

95
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.199
We actually have the players, actually 
are shot. 

96
00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.630
The movie was blurry, the background was 
blurry, but not the players. 

97
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.900
So let me just try to run it again, so we 
can see that even better. 

98
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.826
So it's blurry, but the players are not. 
And we have to do video processing to be 

99
00:06:58.826 --> 00:07:04.085
able to get that special effect. 
Here is yet another example of special 

100
00:07:04.085 --> 00:07:07.122
effect. 
I'm going to run it, and you're going to 

101
00:07:07.122 --> 00:07:12.700
see basically, immediately what type of 
special effects we mean here. 

102
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.406
We see that the movie's running, but 
basically the girl, the lady in the movie 

103
00:07:18.406 --> 00:07:20.777
is actually being repeated. 
Okay, 

104
00:07:20.777 --> 00:07:26.113
and so it's very easy to observe that 
here we see repetitions of what's 

105
00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:29.893
happening. 
And that's a very special effect that is 

106
00:07:29.893 --> 00:07:35.229
used a lot in the movie industry, 
especially sometimes for marketing and 

107
00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:39.008
advertising. 
Let me show you yet another example of 

108
00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:42.492
some really, really interesting special 
effects. 

109
00:07:42.492 --> 00:07:45.940
And this is here. 
So this is a movie. 

110
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.337
Once again we run the movie. 
Looks really nice. 

111
00:07:49.337 --> 00:07:55.097
But actually, after we've finished that 
movie, we might actually want to change 

112
00:07:55.097 --> 00:07:58.569
the background. 
So here is the same movie, with a 

113
00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:00.696
different background. 
Wow. 

114
00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:04.031
This is a lot of work. 
As we are going to see. 

115
00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:09.665
The basic idea is we're going to have to 
be able to segment out this person. 

116
00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:14.260
That's a foreground. 
That's what we want to keep in the movie. 

117
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.449
We're going to have to find it. 
We're going to have to extract it from 

118
00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:24.860
the movie and put it in a new background. 
That's a really fun thing to do. 

119
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.270
I'm going to run this again. 
Here is one movie. 

120
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:34.030
Same movie, with a different background. 
We're going to learn about week five. 

121
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.354
What, 
how to do that, 

122
00:08:35.354 --> 00:08:39.064
how to extract objects from still images 
or from movies. 

123
00:08:39.064 --> 00:08:43.370
And actually these type of things show up 
in commercial products. 

124
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.538
In this case I am showing you a screen 
shot of what is called aftereffects, is 

125
00:08:48.538 --> 00:08:52.910
one of Adobe products. 
And we actually, in collaboration with 

126
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:58.210
Adobe and one of my former students, we 
develop what I just showed you which are 

127
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.648
techniques to extract objects, 
so we can basically put them in your 

128
00:09:02.648 --> 00:09:06.160
backgrounds. 
And I am going to explain to you exactly, 

129
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.710
as many details as I can provide in a 
relatively short video. 

130
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.634
I'm going to show you how this is done 
inside After Effects in Adobe, 

131
00:09:15.634 --> 00:09:19.588
some of the underlying technology that 
appears there. 

132
00:09:19.588 --> 00:09:24.213
So these are just some examples of image 
and video processing. 

133
00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:29.127
We started from image compression. 
The NASA Rovers have to have image 

134
00:09:29.127 --> 00:09:32.659
compression. 
Your digital cameras have to have image 

135
00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:35.988
compression. 
The video that you're watching now, has 

136
00:09:35.988 --> 00:09:39.316
to be compressed before it's uploaded to 
the web. 

137
00:09:39.316 --> 00:09:42.985
And we're going to see in the first week 
of class why, 

138
00:09:42.985 --> 00:09:48.283
why images occupy so much information. 
In the second week, we're going to learn 

139
00:09:48.283 --> 00:09:52.197
how to compress them. 
We also saw special effects like imaging 

140
00:09:52.197 --> 00:09:54.867
painting, 
which we are going to see towards the 

141
00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:58.326
second half of the class. 
And we saw special effects like 

142
00:09:58.326 --> 00:10:02.876
segmentation and changing background. 
And that, we are going to see around week 

143
00:10:02.876 --> 00:10:05.667
five. 
So a lot of really exciting applications. 

144
00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:10.340
Some of them, you are very familiar from 
the movies, from your digital cameras. 

145
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.797
Some of them. 
You actually see everyday, but you're not 

146
00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:18.000
really aware that they are happening. 
And I'm going to help you to basically 

147
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.430
understand that they are actually 
happening, behind the scenes. 

148
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.806
And what we are going to do in the next 
movie, we are going to give a few 

149
00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:30.482
additional examples to further motivate 
you, the importance of image and video 

150
00:10:30.482 --> 00:10:35.338
processing and also how much fun it is to 
understand what's happening behind the
