Hello, and welcome back to our Image in 
Video Processing class. 

2
00:00:04.163 --> 00:00:09.737
In the first two videos in this class, we 
saw numerous examples that I hope that by 

3
00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:14.505
now help you to understand the longer 
title of this class, From Mars to 

4
00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:19.811
Hollywood with a Stop At the Hospital. 
We have seen applications of all of them. 

5
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.606
So those examples. 
Were useful to motivate us, and to 

6
00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:27.105
understand, what is image and video 
processing? 

7
00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:30.528
What are we expecting to learn in this 
class? 

8
00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:35.374
So let me just now spend only just a 
couple of minutes giving you some 

9
00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:38.382
logistics. 
We're going to have nine weeks of class, 

10
00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:41.647
including this week. 
And each week is going to be self 

11
00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:44.591
contained. 
I'm going to start a new topic, and I'm 

12
00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:47.216
going to finish that topic during that 
week. 

13
00:00:47.216 --> 00:00:50.352
Every week is going to have a number of 
short clips. 

14
00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:53.617
So there is not going to be, like, a two 
hours movie. 

15
00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:56.241
But there is going to videos that are 
short. 

16
00:00:56.241 --> 00:01:00.210
So there's going to to be a natural 
stopping and restarting turn. 

17
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.399
Time, in case that you need to come back, 
or you need to stop, and you can't watch 

18
00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.986
all of the movies at the same time. 
Every week, we are going to have quizzes. 

19
00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:14.180
Those that want to get their certificate 
will need to do the quizzes. 

20
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.313
But some of you might just be interested 
in watching the videos without having to 

21
00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:23.632
do the quizzes and you're more than 
welcome to do that if you're not 

22
00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:27.827
interested in the certificate. 
In the quizzes, there's going to be also 

23
00:01:27.827 --> 00:01:32.412
some recommended computer exercise. 
Those are not going to be mandatory, but 

24
00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:36.318
if you have time, I do recommend that you 
do as many as possible. 

25
00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:40.957
So you can experiment yourself, with all 
the techniques that we are learning 

26
00:01:40.957 --> 00:01:43.609
during this class, during this nine 
weeks. 

27
00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.704
One more thing I want to mention is that 
there's a lot of information on the 

28
00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:53.667
website for this class: Recommended 
books, links to web sites, and additional 

29
00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:58.366
material that we are going to be 
incorporating during the class if you 

30
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:02.204
want to expand beyond the material 
provided by these videos. 

31
00:02:02.204 --> 00:02:07.817
Finally I should mention that about half 
of the class the first four to five weeks 

32
00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:12.964
I'm going to be on basic material, 
fundamental material that is still very 

33
00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:16.806
important today. 
And the second half of the class, the 

34
00:02:16.806 --> 00:02:22.243
last four weeks, more or less, are going 
to be more advanced material, basically, 

35
00:02:22.243 --> 00:02:26.303
some of the topics that image processing 
is about today. 

36
00:02:26.303 --> 00:02:31.885
Basically the kind of leading research 
that you can find in universities and 

37
00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.857
companies. 
So, this is it, regarding the logistics, 

38
00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:39.530
and I will see you in the next video, 
where we are going to start with some new 

39
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.429
material on image and video processing. 
Thank you.
