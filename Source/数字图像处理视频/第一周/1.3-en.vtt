00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.304
Hello. 
In the first two videos in this class, we 

2
00:00:03.304 --> 00:00:08.296
saw a lot of examples of images. 
If you manage to see behind me, I wrote, 

3
00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:11.390
images are everywhere, 
images are everywhere. 

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.015
And, I want to show you a few additional 
examples just to make clear, that almost 

5
00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:22.940
any area you're interested on or you're 
working on, images are part of that area. 

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.145
So let's just illustrate something that 
is important to understand some of the 

7
00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:32.757
slides that I'm going to be using next 
and I'm going to use this image that 

8
00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:37.567
basically is the, beautiful image is 
basically the first picture that was 

9
00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:42.443
taken by a US spacecraft of the moon. 
So the image was taken from the, from 

10
00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:47.122
this spacecraft and basically, some of 
the, slides that they're going to be 

11
00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:50.816
using, you're going to see that half the 
cover of the book. 

12
00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:56.329
And, basically, the title of the books, 
one of the books that we recommend in the 

13
00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.586
website for this class. 
And often, also the captions from that 

14
00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:03.866
figure. 
So a lot of the material, a lot, a lot of 

15
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:09.240
the images on the slides for the first 
few weeks of the class are taken from 

16
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.589
this book. 
And then, and basically, this will help 

17
00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:17.963
you to go in case you have the book or 
you have access to a library with the 

18
00:01:17.963 --> 00:01:19.080
book. 
You can go. 

19
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.875
And look at the images, and the material 
around it. 

20
00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:26.215
At the book, not only from my video 
lectures. 

21
00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:30.238
So, let us continue with different 
examples of images. 

22
00:01:30.238 --> 00:01:35.931
One important thing that I want to 
illustrate is that we are mostly familiar 

23
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:39.499
with images that we can see with our 
naked eye. 

24
00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.991
But these are actually a very, very small 
part. 

25
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:46.710
Just these very, very small part of this 
spectrum. 

26
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.962
Images actually can be captured. 
In much, much larger spectrum as you can 

27
00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:56.406
see here. 
Really, really the images that we take 

28
00:01:56.406 --> 00:02:01.212
with our cameras are a very, very small 
portion of the whole spectrum. 

29
00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:04.555
And let me just give you a few examples 
of that. 

30
00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:09.082
For example, these are examples from 
X-rays and its X-ray imaging. 

31
00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:14.236
Some of it we are very familiar. 
When we hear about X-ray we normally have 

32
00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:17.928
this in mind. 
But X-rays are also used, for example, as 

33
00:02:17.928 --> 00:02:21.758
we can see here for the inspection of 
printed circuits. 

34
00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:26.929
Actually one of the most. 
Successful areas of image processing is 

35
00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:30.960
in the automatic inspection of, 
basically, every. 

36
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.750
Printed circuit, every computer, every 
piece of electronic that gets to our 

37
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.899
homes. 
We can have also ultra-violet imaging as 

38
00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.682
we can see here, 
different examples. 

39
00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:47.021
We can have also light microscopy 
imaging. 

40
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:51.235
This is normally used a lot in, for 
biological images. 

41
00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:55.289
But not only. 
Once again we see microscopic imaging 

42
00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.788
used for the inspection of printed 
circuits. 

43
00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:05.227
So we see here that similar applications 
actually use imaging in different parts 

44
00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:11.036
of the spectrum. 
These are satellite images so movality 

45
00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:17.448
called land satile basically they take 
images in, in different spectral bands 

46
00:03:17.448 --> 00:03:23.280
and eh, this are very important for 
numerous applications as well. 

47
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.302
Here is another satellite image. 
Same technology, same type of technology, 

48
00:03:28.302 --> 00:03:33.254
not exactly the same technology. 
But same type of technology for a very 

49
00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:37.440
different application. 
The previous slide was for example, to 

50
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.160
understand the material in the grade 
here, is basically to track a hurricane. 

51
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.472
We have also satellite images of the 
Americas and this illustration is to 

52
00:03:49.472 --> 00:03:56.289
basically just help you locate in the map 
where are these images from so here we 

53
00:03:56.289 --> 00:04:00.807
have this region. 
And, of course we have, the natural 

54
00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:06.855
images that we are used to see, basically 
images that we can take with our cameras 

55
00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:10.764
and then we can look at them with our, 
own naked eyes. 

56
00:04:10.764 --> 00:04:15.853
And once again, those are used for 
numerous applications coming again, 

57
00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:21.679
printed circuit applications, inspection, 
for example of different, manufacturing 

58
00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:26.842
processing or, different kind of 
applications, of course our own images. 

59
00:04:26.842 --> 00:04:32.643
This is just, you know picture of a 
dollar bill or a picture of a license of 

60
00:04:32.643 --> 00:04:38.279
a car, all these taken with the same type 
of technology, but really, for very, very 

61
00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:42.719
different applications. 
And once again, it's very important to 

62
00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:48.062
understand, that there is not only a 
large variability in the type of images 

63
00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:53.182
that we can acquire. 
But sometimes we use multiple to acquire 

64
00:04:53.182 --> 00:04:56.522
the same. 
Image and obtain different information 

65
00:04:56.522 --> 00:05:01.663
the different modalities will give us 
different information about the same 

66
00:05:01.663 --> 00:05:04.610
scene. 
So we are looking we are observing the 

67
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.819
same scene by with different modalities 
with different cameras to save in one 

68
00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.940
word and we can obtain different types of 
information. 

69
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.270
This is ultrasound, another basically 
spectrum of the type of images that we 

70
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.516
can acquire, and we are normally very 
familiar with this type of technology. 

71
00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:29.945
And yet, on our type of images that we 
can acquire. 

72
00:05:29.945 --> 00:05:34.790
And finally, the last example I want to 
give you in this very, very large 

73
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.837
ensemble and very broad ensemble of 
images, are basically artificial images 

74
00:05:39.837 --> 00:05:45.019
that are being created in the computer. 
Normally, the image processing that is 

75
00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:50.336
done for these type of images is very 
different than the image processing that 

76
00:05:50.336 --> 00:05:53.970
is done for images that are acquire. 
And then, and then, 

77
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.010
enter it into the computer. 
We're not going to be talking a lot in 

78
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.692
this class about basically images that 
were created in the computer from 

79
00:06:02.692 --> 00:06:05.706
scratch. 
We're going to be talking about images 

80
00:06:05.706 --> 00:06:10.580
that were basically were acquired and 
then enter into the computer for some 

81
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.282
analysis for processing. 
So these are just some examples. 

82
00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:19.349
And now what we're going to do next is 
basically go inside and understand the 

83
00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:23.538
basic components of images. 
What are pixels and how images are 

84
00:06:23.538 --> 00:06:26.579
manipulated. 
And we're going to already see some 

85
00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:31.444
examples of very simple processing in 
images, but still very useful ones.
