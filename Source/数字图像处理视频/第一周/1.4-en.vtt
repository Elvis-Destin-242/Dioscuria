00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.107
Without any doubt, one of the main 
clients of image and video process is us. 

2
00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:10.830
So let's just learn something about our 
own visual system. 

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.360
Here, we have a very simplified cross 
section of the human eye. 

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.880
We have the cornea, here, we have the 
lenses and we have the retina. 

5
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.897
The retina is where the images that we 
see, 

6
00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:35.200
basically images that come to our eyes 
are projected on. 

7
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.819
So basically, as we see in this figure, 
we have the scene. 

8
00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:46.405
So this is the actual scene in the real 
world and it's projected into our retina, 

9
00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:51.785
here in the back of our eye. 
The retina basically has sensors, 

10
00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:57.934
as we are going to talk in a second. 
And the images are projected onto the 

11
00:00:57.934 --> 00:01:01.624
retina, and then they are sent into the 
brain. 

12
00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:05.080
Okay? 
So the retina is full of sensors, 

13
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.205
all over the retina. 
And naturally we have two type of 

14
00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:10.885
sensors. 
We have cones. 

15
00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:15.393
The cones are basically marked here by 
the continuous line, 

16
00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:19.594
that's the density of cones that we have 
in the retina. 

17
00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:24.178
And as we can see, there is a very, very 
high density of cones. 

18
00:01:24.178 --> 00:01:28.380
We see a very, very high peak of cones 
around the fovea. 

19
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.459
The fovea is basically where we can see 
the best. 

20
00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:38.787
Cones are very good at seeing details. 
Cones are very, very good at seeing in 

21
00:01:38.787 --> 00:01:42.617
bright light. 
So, we are, without us noticing of 

22
00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:48.278
course, in our regular scenario, 
we're always trying to move our eyes, 

23
00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:54.107
such that basically the scene is 
projected as much as possible into the 

24
00:01:54.107 --> 00:01:58.270
fovea region of our retina. 
So those are the cones. 

25
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.276
Okay? And they, actually, their density 
the amount of cones, the amount of 

26
00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:09.420
receptors goes down when we get away from 
the fovea. 

27
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.833
There is a different type of receptors 
basically of sensors, which are called 

28
00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:24.152
the rods and those are, sorry? 
The rods are basically marked in this 

29
00:02:24.152 --> 00:02:29.367
picture with these lines. 
So the concentration of the rods is 

30
00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:33.298
actually a big more uniform across the 
whole retina. 

31
00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:39.346
Basically, as we can see in this picture, 
there is of course, a very low, basically 

32
00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:45.696
nonexistent concentration where the cones 
take over and the rods are actually very 

33
00:02:45.696 --> 00:02:51.744
good to, not to look at details, but to 
get a general idea of what's happening at 

34
00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:58.030
the scene and they're actually very good 
to see in very dim light. 

35
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.376
Okay? 
So, between the, the cones that are very 

36
00:03:02.376 --> 00:03:10.179
good at seeing at bright light and very, 
very concentrated around the fovea and 

37
00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:17.573
the rods which are spread all around the 
retina and are very good at seeing at 

38
00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:22.110
very low light. 
We get an extremely large spectrum of 

39
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.963
light that we can observe with our naked 
eye. 

40
00:03:25.963 --> 00:03:32.554
Before I detail a bit more about that, 
I want to tell you that there's a region 

41
00:03:32.554 --> 00:03:40.224
in the retina that has basically no 
sensors and that's that region here, 

42
00:03:40.224 --> 00:03:45.171
that's called the blind spot. 
Basically, there's no receptors there and 

43
00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:49.502
we're going to notice that. 
And we're going to discuss that in a few 

44
00:03:49.502 --> 00:03:54.088
weeks when we talk about an image 
processing technique calling painting, 

45
00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:59.183
which as we have seen in the first videos 
is about making, removing objects from 

46
00:03:59.183 --> 00:04:02.495
the scene. 
We're going to be talking about the blind 

47
00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:07.066
spot a bit more and why or how. 
It's believed that we actually don't 

48
00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:12.260
notice that there is a region of our 
vision system that basically there are, 

49
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.634
there are no reception of what's 
happening in the scene, but we are 

50
00:04:16.634 --> 00:04:21.434
completely unaware of that. 
So, going back to the point that we have 

51
00:04:21.434 --> 00:04:26.899
an extremely, extremely broad range of 
intensities that we can see when we 

52
00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:32.984
combine the cones and the rods, we should 
note that as depicting this figure. 

53
00:04:32.984 --> 00:04:39.956
We are actually, we can actually perceive 
a very, very broad range of intensities. 

54
00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:45.795
So this is in logarithmic, okay? 
It's really a huge part of intensities 

55
00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:52.680
that we are able to perceive and some of 
it is actually perceived by the rods, 

56
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.528
these low intensity. 
Some if it is actually perceived by the 

57
00:04:56.528 --> 00:04:59.950
cones when we start going into high 
intensities. 

58
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.600
One of the issues is that we're able to 
perceive very, very large range of 

59
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.480
intensities, but not at the same time. 
So we cannot see in very dark rooms and 

60
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.146
very light regions of the room at the 
same time. 

61
00:05:15.146 --> 00:05:17.590
Okay? 
So we, we can see very dark, 

62
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.103
we can see in very dark rooms, we can 
also see in very light rooms. We cannot 

63
00:05:23.103 --> 00:05:28.760
see at the same time and what we need is 
actually to adapt. So at certain level 

64
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.915
of, at certain level of intensity, for 
example, this point, we are actually 

65
00:05:33.915 --> 00:05:39.210
adapt and we are able to see this range. 
If we are adopting around here, we are 

66
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.135
not able to see or at least not see very 
easily, around here or very, very low 

67
00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:47.397
intensities. 
That's what happens. We experience this 

68
00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:52.322
all the time when we're going to a dark 
movie theater. At first, we don't see 

69
00:05:52.322 --> 00:05:57.438
very well and after a while we adapt, and 
we actually see where we are going, and 

70
00:05:57.438 --> 00:06:01.340
where do we need to see. 
And the same when we go into a light 

71
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.640
room. 
Now, 

72
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.168
it's very important that, regardless of 
the background light, we're able to 

73
00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:12.277
distinguish the details and, and at, at 
different levels. 

74
00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:16.610
So when we go into a movie theater and 
the lights are off, 

75
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.822
we don't want to see a uniform movie 
theater. 

76
00:06:19.822 --> 00:06:23.035
We need to find where basically, our 
seats are. 

77
00:06:23.035 --> 00:06:29.011
So we need to be able to discriminate 
even between very low levels of light and 

78
00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:34.540
we also need to be able to discriminate 
between very high levels of light. 

79
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.650
So, that's what this adaptation allow us 
to do. 

80
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.492
And there are very, very good experiments 
in the, in the literature to try to 

81
00:06:43.492 --> 00:06:48.334
understand, what kind of discrimination 
we can obtain at different levels of 

82
00:06:48.334 --> 00:06:51.426
light. 
And these experiments are basically very 

83
00:06:51.426 --> 00:06:54.922
simple in its, in its most fundamental 
form. 

84
00:06:54.922 --> 00:07:01.013
So there's a background light, and we 
basically draw a circle in the middle, 

85
00:07:01.013 --> 00:07:07.083
and we start changing the light of that 
circle until the observer says oh, I 

86
00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:12.674
notice that there is a circle in there. 
We can go up, making it lighter. 

87
00:07:12.674 --> 00:07:18.424
We can go down, making it darker. 
And then we measure, how much change are 

88
00:07:18.424 --> 00:07:23.296
we able to perceive? 
Now, the amount of change that we need to 

89
00:07:23.296 --> 00:07:27.290
perceive, depends, actually on the 
background light, 

90
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.968
and that's what's called Weber law and 
this is shown in this picture. 

91
00:07:32.968 --> 00:07:39.140
It's a very interesting effect that if we 
are in very low light conditions, 

92
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:48.400
we need the delta i, the change to be 
relatively high. If we are in very high 

93
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.437
background light, we don't need so much 
change. 

94
00:07:52.437 --> 00:07:59.546
So the basic idea is that if we are in a 
very dark room, very small changes in, in 

95
00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:05.865
light, very, very small changes in, in, 
in brightness will not be perceived. 

96
00:08:05.865 --> 00:08:11.702
We actually need much wider range of 
changes, basically a, a much larger 

97
00:08:11.702 --> 00:08:15.047
change. 
So, basically two things that are very, 

98
00:08:15.047 --> 00:08:21.068
that both of them are very dark and very 
similar, we won't be able to distinguish 

99
00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:25.349
between them. 
On the other hand, when the background is 

100
00:08:25.349 --> 00:08:30.583
already very bright, we don't need so 
much difference between the different 

101
00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:34.700
levels to be able to distinguish between 
different objects. 

102
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:40.283
And that, as I say, is called the Weber's 
Law and it's extremely important in the 

103
00:08:40.283 --> 00:08:45.587
design of images, and in the design of 
cameras, and design of different image 

104
00:08:45.587 --> 00:08:49.774
acquisition devices. 
Because if we want to distinguish between 

105
00:08:49.774 --> 00:08:54.729
two objects that both of them are very 
dark, we need to be very careful. 

106
00:08:54.729 --> 00:09:00.129
Because we know that we need a very large 
difference between those objects. 

107
00:09:00.129 --> 00:09:06.192
We are actually going to learn in Week 3, 
actually, how to make these differences 

108
00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:12.180
even larger so we can distinguish them. 
So if we take a picture of two very dark 

109
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.793
objects that are different objects, but 
are basically a brightness is very 

110
00:09:17.793 --> 00:09:23.032
similar, we're going to be able to 
process that in the computer, so we can, 

111
00:09:23.032 --> 00:09:27.440
even with our naked eye distinguish 
between them. 

112
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:36.064
So, the conclusion of this part is that 
we are able to observe and understand and 

113
00:09:36.064 --> 00:09:43.624
make interpretation of images in a very, 
very wide range of brightness, 

114
00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:48.394
but we are not able to do all that at the 
same time. 

115
00:09:48.394 --> 00:09:55.636
We need to adapt, and if we are adapting 
to dark, then we are less sensitive that 

116
00:09:55.636 --> 00:10:02.340
if we adapted to bright areas, to, to, 
very high levels of, of light. 

117
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.687
Another very interesting aspect of our 
visual system is that our visual 

118
00:10:07.687 --> 00:10:10.956
perception depends on what's surrounding 
us. 

119
00:10:10.956 --> 00:10:16.378
One example is already Weber's law, 
if we can perceive this circle in the 

120
00:10:16.378 --> 00:10:21.280
middle depends on actually the 
brightness, the luminance, around it. 

121
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.999
The other is what's called Mach bands. 
And it might be a bit difficult to see 

122
00:10:26.999 --> 00:10:32.421
this through the video, but let me 
explain it and in the next slide, we're 

123
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:40.050
going to see an even more clear example. 
The basic idea is that white are 2% here. 

124
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:45.915
I present you here a black region, 
a bit lighter, a bit lighter, a bit 

125
00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:51.003
lighter, and so on. 
The actual intensities that I'm painting 

126
00:10:51.003 --> 00:10:56.868
each one of these is, is constant. 
So basically, the intensity here is 

127
00:10:56.868 --> 00:11:02.906
constant as we can see it here. 
The intensity here is constant, is this 

128
00:11:02.906 --> 00:11:04.631
intensity, 
and so on. 

129
00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:10.410
So the intensity of every single one of 
these segments is constant. 

130
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:17.262
Our perception actually, doesn't look 
like this, it's actually, doesn't look 

131
00:11:17.262 --> 00:11:21.650
constant like in this. 
It's actually like here. 

132
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:27.648
We perceive that when a dark region is 
closer here, so we are at the boundary 

133
00:11:27.648 --> 00:11:33.725
between here, we actually perceive that 
the dark is even darker, and the bright 

134
00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:37.775
is even brighter. 
You might be able to perceive that in 

135
00:11:37.775 --> 00:11:41.505
these regions. 
For example, that basically, we believe 

136
00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:46.884
that because we're coming here into 
brighter region, we're coming from this 

137
00:11:46.884 --> 00:11:51.259
side, it actually looks darker. 
We perceive it as being darker. 

138
00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:55.061
It's not actually, but we perceive it as 
being darker. 

139
00:11:55.061 --> 00:12:00.010
I'm going to erase my annotation so maybe 
you can see that a bit better. 

140
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.170
Let me just point again to where you 
should be looking at. 

141
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.114
You should be looking at this boundary, 
for example. 

142
00:12:07.114 --> 00:12:09.712
I'm going to draw on top of it and then 
erase it, 

143
00:12:09.712 --> 00:12:14.158
you should be looking at this boundary 
that, when you're coming from the left, 

144
00:12:14.158 --> 00:12:16.756
it looks actually darker than it actually 
is. 

145
00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:21.086
And when you're coming from the right, it 
looks actually brighter than it is. 

146
00:12:21.086 --> 00:12:25.567
So let me just erase this and give you 
couple of seconds to try to see if you 

147
00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:27.796
see that. 
But if you don't, don't worry. 

148
00:12:27.796 --> 00:12:32.380
We're going to go into to the next slide 
and it's going to be even more clear. 

149
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:40.614
Here, let me explain what we have. 
We have three rectangles that actually 

150
00:12:40.614 --> 00:12:48.154
have exactly the same brightness. 
So, they were painted with exactly the 

151
00:12:48.154 --> 00:12:53.602
same paint. 
Now, the background have, were painted 

152
00:12:53.602 --> 00:13:01.777
with three different levels of gray. 
This is dark, this is light, and this is 

153
00:13:01.777 --> 00:13:07.445
in between. 
And I hope you can perceive, even through 

154
00:13:07.445 --> 00:13:12.951
the video, that. 
Let me just go back. 

155
00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:18.984
You got this, 
looks darker than this one, because this 

156
00:13:18.984 --> 00:13:22.665
one, 
I'm going to erase all my annotation in a 

157
00:13:22.665 --> 00:13:28.999
second, so you can look at that again. 
This one is surrounded by a brighter 

158
00:13:28.999 --> 00:13:35.248
background than this one that is actually 
surrounded by a very, very dark 

159
00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:39.700
background. 
And then the perception is that this one 

160
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.151
is actually perceived as being darker 
than this one. 

161
00:13:44.151 --> 00:13:47.897
Let's see if we can see that once more. 
Okay? 

162
00:13:47.897 --> 00:13:53.684
I hope you can perceive that. 
So there's a lot of visual illusions that 

163
00:13:53.684 --> 00:13:59.960
and, and tricks that our visual system 
plays with us and here is yet one more. 

164
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.531
The idea here, 
there are a number of things. 

165
00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:07.236
Once again, I'm going to use my 
annotation, 

166
00:14:07.236 --> 00:14:11.696
then I'm going to erase it. 
So, I hope that all of you can perceive 

167
00:14:11.696 --> 00:14:16.420
here a square. 
This actually not a square, 

168
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.678
but you can perceive, 
you believe that there is a square. 

169
00:14:20.678 --> 00:14:24.820
So you believe that there is a square 
right there, 

170
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.961
but you, actually, there is not. 
There is actually, absolutely no 

171
00:14:29.961 --> 00:14:36.180
difference between the colors when I go 
around here, between the level of y. 

172
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:43.143
There is actually no difference here. 
But, this gives us the illusion that 

173
00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:53.172
there's actually a square here. 
I hope you can see it now. 

174
00:14:53.172 --> 00:15:01.340
Similarly, in this image, we actually 
have straight lines coming in. 

175
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.685
Nothing in the middle, 
but when I'm going to erase that. I hope 

176
00:15:06.685 --> 00:15:12.260
you will be able to perceive that there 
is kind of a circle form in the middle. 

177
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.371
So we perceive. 
It's actually very interesting to see 

178
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:20.794
that sometimes the actual responses of 
our visual system. 

179
00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:26.690
So if it were a measure, the actual 
firing of the neurons in certain regions 

180
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:31.267
of our visual system, 
they're identical to those that will 

181
00:15:31.267 --> 00:15:37.862
happen if I actually drew a circle there. 
So, this is a visual illusion that is as 

182
00:15:37.862 --> 00:15:42.440
strong as an actual drawing. 
here is yet another example, 

183
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:48.274
that because here we actually make an 
angle like this, and here we make an 

184
00:15:48.274 --> 00:15:55.120
angle like this, most of us will perceive 
this line as being longer than this line. 

185
00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:02.455
The same on the figure on the right. 
Most of us will perceive that these lines 

186
00:16:02.455 --> 00:16:09.228
are actually not parallel, 
but they actually are and the perception 

187
00:16:09.228 --> 00:16:15.102
that they are actually meeting each other 
is a result of basically a visual 

188
00:16:15.102 --> 00:16:18.966
illusion. 
So it's important when we're doing image 

189
00:16:18.966 --> 00:16:25.149
processing to understand how our basic 
understanding of the visual system works. 

190
00:16:25.149 --> 00:16:31.178
Once again, because the main client of 
image and video processing is basically 

191
00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:34.158
us. 
So, in the next video, we're going to 

192
00:16:34.158 --> 00:16:39.322
start seeing formulas. 
So far, I have shown you basic images and 

193
00:16:39.322 --> 00:16:44.584
some basic understanding of the human 
visual system really basic understanding. 

194
00:16:44.584 --> 00:16:49.780
Some people spend their whole careers 
studying the visual system, so these are 

195
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.577
just some very, very basic process that 
are important for us to continue. 

196
00:16:54.577 --> 00:16:59.107
And now we are going to start talking 
about what are pixels, and what's 

197
00:16:59.107 --> 00:17:03.237
condensation, and what's quantization, 
and what's discretization, 

198
00:17:03.237 --> 00:17:07.567
and what are those megapixel cameras or 
even gigapixel cameras. 

199
00:17:07.567 --> 00:17:10.739
And what does all that mean. Thank you.
