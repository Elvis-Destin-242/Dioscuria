00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.269
Welcome back to the Image and Video 
Processing class. In the previous video, 

2
00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:08.653
we saw a number of examples that show 
what image and video processing can do 

3
00:00:08.653 --> 00:00:11.386
for us. 
Now we are going to see a few additional 

4
00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:14.062
examples. 
We're going to start again from consumer 

5
00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:18.218
images, images of the type that you are 
familar with, and then we're going to 

6
00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:22.659
move to a couple of examples of medical 
imaging, an area where image and video 

7
00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:27.043
processing has been extremely successful 
and a very important area by itself. 

8
00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:31.370
So once again, a couple of additional 
examples of consumer images and videos. 

9
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.321
So this is a very interesting example of 
what video processing can do for us. 

10
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:41.402
Let us watch this movies for a second. 
So here we have two kids in one video and 

11
00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:45.132
two kids in another video doing exactly 
the same activity. 

12
00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:50.020
We want the computer to automatically 
identify that, although, these are very 

13
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.850
different people, very different 
backgrounds, 

14
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.607
in completely different jumping gear, 
and a house in one, and no house in the 

15
00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:01.113
other in the background. 
We want to make sure the computer 

16
00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:05.871
understands that in spite of all those 
different things, the activity is the 

17
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:07.812
same activity. 
Kids keeps jumping. 

18
00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:12.507
We want the computer to actually be able 
to say that that activity is very 

19
00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:16.794
different than this one, 
which is actually a person playing with a 

20
00:01:16.794 --> 00:01:22.163
ball, but this particular one should be 
identified to be exactly the same at this 

21
00:01:22.163 --> 00:01:26.008
other one, which is another person 
playing with a football. 

22
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:31.245
So, we want the computer to automatically 
classify these videos for us based on 

23
00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:36.614
what activity is happening in the videos. 
Let's just see another very interesting 

24
00:01:36.614 --> 00:01:39.663
example. 
I'm going to play this video in a second. 

25
00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:42.995
If you see different frames surrounding 
the person, 

26
00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:47.551
so green and red, that would mean that 
the computer has identified that 

27
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:50.824
basically the person is doing a different 
activity. 

28
00:01:50.824 --> 00:01:55.893
If you see exactly the same color of the 
frame, so maybe both green or both red, 

29
00:01:55.893 --> 00:02:01.090
means that the computer has automatically 
identified that the person is actually 

30
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.491
doing the same activity or the same type 
of activity. 

31
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:09.072
So let's watch this movie. 
So different colors, that means different 

32
00:02:09.072 --> 00:02:12.198
activities. 
And now, same colors, meaning same 

33
00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:15.002
activities. 
And one more example. 

34
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:20.078
In this case, we actually have three 
different persons at, at three different 

35
00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:23.284
rows and we have in the left, the grand 
truth. 

36
00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:28.626
That happens very often in this type of 
[INAUDIBLE] in image and video processing 

37
00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:34.036
where you know what you expect, so you 
can verify if your algorithms are working 

38
00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:37.375
properly. 
On the right, we actually have the actual 

39
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:42.451
recite of the algorithm. And once again, 
if you see frames of the same color, 

40
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:47.277
mean, means that in spite of the fact 
people are the different people, that 

41
00:02:47.277 --> 00:02:50.978
computer has identified that they are 
doing exactly the same activity. 

42
00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:55.277
If you see different frames, different 
colors, means the computer has identified 

43
00:02:55.277 --> 00:02:59.720
they're doing different activities. 
So let's just watch the movie. 

44
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.231
So look that three of them are green and 
now this move to yellow which means that 

45
00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:12.340
the computer understood that the person 
changed his or her own activity, move 

46
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.565
from running to jumping. 
So that's another thing that we want the 

47
00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:22.790
computer to do for us, to identify what's 
happening in the images. 

48
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.569
Sometimes we actually want much simpler 
things. 

49
00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.498
For example, here, we might just want 
these very poorly acquire image to become 

50
00:03:32.498 --> 00:03:36.601
this very nice image. 
This is something that happens to us all 

51
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:39.645
the time. 
We take an image that is not, it doesn't 

52
00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:44.344
look as good as we want it to look. 
For example, this, this is an extreme 

53
00:03:44.344 --> 00:03:49.109
case, We're going to understand what 
happened actually in this image and we 

54
00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:54.205
want to automatically, after we have 
taken the image, we don't want to go back 

55
00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:58.109
and take again that image. 
We actually want the computer do 

56
00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.220
automatically for us give us a very nice 
image. 

57
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.769
These aren't just examples of things we 
are familiar with. 

58
00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.664
A more complicated example is here, yet 
another movie, but basically what we want 

59
00:04:09.664 --> 00:04:13.825
is to be able to identify everything that 
is happening in the movie. 

60
00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:18.659
This is sometimes called computer vision 
and not image processing, although, the 

61
00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:22.820
two areas are close really, really, 
really close related and we are going to 

62
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.390
discuss that during the next coming 
weeks. 

63
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.961
All this has been about consumer imaging. 
Image and video processing, in 

64
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:37.566
particular, image processing, but also a 
bit more in these recent days and recent 

65
00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:42.610
years, video processing is extremely 
important in medical and biological 

66
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.972
images. 
And let me give you a couple of examples 

67
00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:51.086
that are very exciting applications, 
where image and video processing can 

68
00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:54.870
actually make tremendous impact in 
society and health. 

69
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.341
So this is a particular application. 
We're going to talk about this 

70
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:02.695
application, actually, the last week of 
the class. 

71
00:05:02.695 --> 00:05:07.516
And, this is a particular application 
that is related to neurosurgery. 

72
00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:12.757
I'm going to describe this application 
again, as I said, in the last week of 

73
00:05:12.757 --> 00:05:15.691
this class. 
But the basic idea is that the 

74
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:22.179
neurosurgeon implants in the brain an 
electrode and sends some excitation to 

75
00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:27.060
that electrode, 
and this is extremely important for many, 

76
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.250
many problems, like Parkinson, tremor, 
depression or or, or other problems. 

77
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.544
But a fundamental problem is that a 
neurosurgeon needs to see inside the 

78
00:05:38.544 --> 00:05:42.398
brain, 
needs to know where he or she is going 

79
00:05:42.398 --> 00:05:46.255
inside the brain. 
And in order to do that, we actually, in 

80
00:05:46.255 --> 00:05:52.741
order to know where to implant the 
electrode, and where exactly to go. 

81
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:58.899
The neurosurgeon will take images of our 
inside of the brain through MRI, CT, or 

82
00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:04.901
other disciplines, and try to get a map, 
try to get basically what we see from 

83
00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:10.124
Google Maps or from other images. 
They want to know, have a map from inside 

84
00:06:10.124 --> 00:06:13.397
our brain. 
So they want to be able to know 

85
00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:17.061
everything that is happening in our brain 
here. 

86
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:22.700
So one of areas that they want to implant 
electrodes, we find it here. 

87
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.378
So, this is the, this fancy and beautiful 
in color images that you see here is a 

88
00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:33.696
combination of multiple modalities that 
are used to look inside our brain. 

89
00:06:33.696 --> 00:06:38.296
They are put together with techniques 
that we are going to discuss, 

90
00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:43.975
and then, you can create these beautiful 
images that localize and also tell you 

91
00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:48.360
how different parts of the brain are 
actually connected. 

92
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.015
Once you do that, you can actually map, 
as I mention, you can actually map the 

93
00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:59.893
brain and understand these are actually 
electrodes that were implanted and you 

94
00:06:59.893 --> 00:07:05.102
can localize where exactly is the 
electrodes are touching in the brain. 

95
00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:11.054
So it's really seeing inside our head and 
a lot of image processing needs to go 

96
00:07:11.054 --> 00:07:16.338
behind this to make this possible. 
And, as I say, this is a very exciting 

97
00:07:16.338 --> 00:07:21.770
area, because the contribution of new 
image processing here is tremendous. 

98
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.741
Similarly, we can look HIV research. 
Again, we're going to discuss this more, 

99
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:32.063
at the end, the last week of class. 
We're going to have entire lecture of 

100
00:07:32.063 --> 00:07:36.264
this particular problem and the image 
processing challenges. 

101
00:07:36.264 --> 00:07:41.656
So this is a, basically a virus and this 
is a schematic of an HIV virus. And for 

102
00:07:41.656 --> 00:07:46.557
reasons that we're going to discuss 
later, we need to identify the actual 

103
00:07:46.557 --> 00:07:48.798
shape of this, 
this is schematic. 

104
00:07:48.798 --> 00:07:53.909
You might say, why is this so difficult? 
I'm going to show you that in just a 

105
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:59.116
second. 
The basic, idea is that we need to be 

106
00:07:59.116 --> 00:08:04.603
able to identify that what I've just 
marked to you looks like this. 

107
00:08:04.603 --> 00:08:11.400
This is a three-dimensional rendering of 
exactly that what's marked in the picture 

108
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:18.197
as the gp120 and the gp41. So that's what 
called the envelope and that's a very 

109
00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:24.830
important part of the virus that a virus 
uses to basically latch into the next 

110
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.580
cell and identifying that shape is, is 
very, very important. 

111
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.214
What's behind the scenes? 
So why is this so difficult? 

112
00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:39.115
Because actually what you get is images 
like this. 

113
00:08:39.115 --> 00:08:44.420
basically this is what the schematic of 
what I showed you before, 

114
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.789
and these are, these small envelopes I 
showed you before. 

115
00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:52.222
Okay? 
And from images like this one, you need 

116
00:08:52.222 --> 00:08:58.240
to be able to do reconstructions like, 
like the ones I'm showing you now. 

117
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:05.692
Okay? So this is basic science that has a 
tremendous potential contribution into 

118
00:09:05.692 --> 00:09:11.840
the development of vaccines or the 
understanding of different viruses. 

119
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:18.108
Finally, sometimes image processing, as 
we saw that, that it can help 

120
00:09:18.108 --> 00:09:22.733
neurosurgery can help others kinds of 
surgery to make them safer. 

121
00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:28.284
This is a particular application where 
it's important to understand where the 

122
00:09:28.284 --> 00:09:31.579
esophagus is. 
So, cardiac ablation which is a very 

123
00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:34.869
common surgery, 
when it's done, it avoids basically 

124
00:09:34.869 --> 00:09:39.476
touching it and maybe damaging it. 
So once again, in our application of 

125
00:09:39.476 --> 00:09:43.623
image processing, which we're going to 
discuss during this week. 

126
00:09:43.623 --> 00:09:47.242
We are going to discuss different type of 
applications. 

127
00:09:47.242 --> 00:09:52.112
We're going to touch on some of them. 
We won't be able to touch on all the 

128
00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:57.343
medical imaging applications out there, 
but we're going to touch enough to give 

129
00:09:57.343 --> 00:10:02.930
you an idea of why image processing is so 
important in the area of medical imaging 

130
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.844
and biological data. 
So to conclude, we have, in these two 

131
00:10:07.844 --> 00:10:13.517
videos, we have seen a large number of 
examples going from scientific data from 

132
00:10:13.517 --> 00:10:19.333
Mars to consumer videos and images like 
in the movies or like images that you, we 

133
00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:23.426
take with our own cameras all the way to 
medical imaging. 

134
00:10:23.426 --> 00:10:28.811
And we're going to discuss during the 
next, nine weeks starting with this week, 

135
00:10:28.811 --> 00:10:34.484
the basic techniques that we need to be 
able to achieve all what, we've just seen 

136
00:10:34.484 --> 00:10:37.800
that we want or we need to do with 
images. 

137
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.287
So, see you in the next video.
